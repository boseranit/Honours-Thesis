\section{Introduction}
Topological quantum fields theories can be constructed based on the
Mathai-Quillen formalism. Although the main breakthroughs in these theories have
been provided in their formulation as twisted $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric
theories, this provides a useful geometric framework.\cite{TQFTbook}

In general, Witten type TQFTs are associated with a moduli problem characterized
by three basic data: fields, symmetries, and equations.
In the case of Donaldson-Witten theory, the configuration space is the space of
connections $\mathcal{A}$ on a bundle $E$, whose elements are fields 
$\phi$ over a four-manifold  $X$.  the group $\mathcal{G}$ is the group of gauge
transformations associated with $G$, so we are led to consider the quotient
space  $\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{G}$. Within this quotient, the moduli space is
defined by a set of equations $s(\phi)=0$, and the self-duality equations can be
regarded as sections of a bundle
$\mathcal{E}=\mathcal{A}\times_{\mathcal{G}}\Omega^{2,+}(X,g_E)$. (What does
this mean?)
  
Recall that there are two quite different approaches for calculating the Euler number
$\chi(X) = \chi(TX)$ of an oriented even dimensional manifold $X$. 
This first is topological, and counts
the signed isolated zeros of a vector field on $X$, via the Hopf theorem. The
second is differential geometric and represents  $\chi(X)$ as the integral over
$X$ of a density constructed from the curvature of a connection on $X$, via
the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. 

The Mathai-Quillen formula \cite{MQformula} is a more general formula which interpolates between
the two approaches. It relies on the construction of a form $\chi_{s,\nabla}(E)$ in
the Euler class which depends
on both a section  $s$ and connection  $\nabla$.  

\section{Integration along the fiber}
Let $\pi: E\to B$ be an oriented fiber bundle over a manifold $B$ with fiber $F$.
Suppose $\dim F = m$ and $\dim B = n$.
\begin{defn}
	\underline{Integration along the fiber} is a map $\pi_* : \Omega^*(E)\to
	\Omega^{*-m}(B)$, defined as follows. Let $\alpha\in \Omega^k(E)$ and
	$v_1,\ldots,v_{k-m} \in T_bB$ 
	\[
	(\pi_*\alpha)_b(v_1,\ldots,v_{k-m}) = \int_{\pi^{-1}(b)}
	\alpha(\widetilde{v}_1,\ldots,\widetilde{v}_{k-m},-)
	\] 
	where $\widetilde{v}_i$ is any lift of $v_i$ to $TE$. 
\end{defn}
The integral is taken by pulling back the form via a trivialisation $\phi 
:F \xrightarrow{\simeq} \pi^{-1}(b)$. 
To show that this is well defined, we need to check 
\begin{itemize}
	\item the integral is independent of choice of trivialisation
	\item definition is independent of the choices of lifts
	\item integrand is a smooth differential form on $\pi^{-1}(b)$
	\item $\pi_*\alpha$ is a smooth differential form on $B$
\end{itemize}
Denote $\beta = \alpha(\widetilde{v}_1,\ldots,\widetilde{v}_{k-m},-)$.\\
(1) Choice of trivialisation. This comes from the fact that the trivialisation
is oriented. Let $\phi_1,\phi_2 : \to F \to \pi^{-1}(b)$ be two trivialisations,
so $\psi:=\phi_1^{-1}\phi_2 : F \to F$ is an orientation preserving diffeomorphism. 
Hence, the integral is locally written as 
\[
\int_{F} \phi_1^*\beta \odif{f_1}\ldots\odif{f_m} 
= \int_{F} \psi^*\phi_1^*\beta  \odif{g_1}\ldots\odif{g_m}
\] 
where $g_i = \psi(f_i)$ are the transformed coordinates. Note that
$\det(D\psi)=1$ by assumption, so the two integrals are equal by the change of 
coordinates theorem. 

Moreover, for vector bundles and principal bnudles, the definition is also 
independent of the choice of oriented trivialisation with the same orientation. 
Even if $\phi_1,\phi_2$ are taken from different trivialisations, the
transition function $\phi_1^{-1}\phi_2: F \to F$ will be an orientation
preserving diffeomorphism due to the extra structure on $\phi_1$ and
$\phi_2$, i.e. linear isomorphism or $G$-equivariant map. 

(2) Choice of lifts. Fix $a\in \pi^{-1}(b)$, and let $\widetilde{v}_1'$ be 
another lift of $v_1\in T_bB$. That is, 
$D\pi|_a(\widetilde{v}_1)=D\pi|_a(\widetilde{v}_1')=v_1$. So
$\widetilde{v}_1'-\widetilde{v}_1\in \ker D\pi|_a = T_a(p^{-1}(b))$.  

Since the fiber dimension is $m$, $m+1$ vectors 
$w_1,\ldots,w_m,\widetilde{v}_1'-\widetilde{v}_1 \in T_a(\pi^{-1}(b))$ are
linearly dependent, and therefore 
\[
\alpha(\widetilde{v}_1'-\widetilde{v}_1,
\widetilde{v}_2,\ldots,\widetilde{v}_{k-m},w_1,\ldots,w_m) = 0
\] 
which shows the integrand is independent of the choice of lifts.

(3) Integrand is smooth on $\pi^{-1}(b)$. Since $\alpha$ is a smooth 
differential form, we only need to check that its dependence on the lifted 
vectors is smooth. Given a local trivialisation $\phi : U\times F
\xrightarrow{\simeq} \pi^{-1}(U)$, at $a\in\pi^{-1}(b)$ we can choose the lift 
$\widetilde{v}_1 = D\phi|_{\phi^{-1}(a)}(v_1)$. This is a smooth choice, and
hence $\alpha$ is smooth by part (2). 

(4) $\pi_*\alpha$ is a smooth differential form on $B$. To see this, we need
to write it out in coordinates. Let 
$dx_1,\ldots,dx_{n},dt_1,\ldots,dt_m \in T^*E$ be coordinates for $E|_U$ based
on a trivialisation, such that 
$t_i$ are coordinate functions for $F$ and $x_i$ are coordinate functions for
$B$. Assume $\alpha$ is homogeneous and has a factor of 
$dt_1\wedge \cdots\wedge dt_m$, since
otherwise $\beta$ will not be a top form on $\pi^{-1}(b)$. Then integration
along the fiber is locally described by 
\[
\alpha = f(x,t_1,\ldots,t_n) \odif{t_1}\cdots \odif{t_m} \wedge \pi^*\eta 
\mapsto \int_{\pi^{-1}(b)} f(x,t_1,\ldots,t_n) \odif{t_1}\cdots \odif{t_m}
\wedge \pi^*\eta
\] 
for some $\eta\in \Omega(B)$. It is now apparent that the dependence on $x$,
i.e. the coordinates for  $B$, is smooth. 

In this chapter, we are interested in integration along the fiber for oriented
vector bundles in particular, however the general definition will be needed
later when we integrate over $G$-orbits of principal bundles. The case of vector
bundles is slightly simpler, because the fiber has global coordinates. Note that
not all differential forms are integrable, so we typically define $\pi_*$ only
on the subset which is compactly supported, or at least compactly supported
along the fiber. 
\begin{prop} % Bott Tu p62
	Integration along the fiber $\pi_*$ commutes with the exterior derivative
	$d$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	
\end{proof}

Integration along the fiber can also be defined by the property (b) in the
following proposition, where the existence of $\pi_*\alpha$ can be seen as a 
generalisation of Fubini's theorem.
\begin{prop}[Projection formula] %  Bott Tu Prop 6.15 p63, BGV 1.15
	Let $\pi : E \to B$ be a fiber bundle with  $m$-dimensional fiber $F$, and
	both $B$ and  $E$ are oriented. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a), leftmargin=\parindent]
	    \item For $\alpha\in \Omega_{cv}(E)$ and $\beta\in\Omega(B)$, 
	\[
		\pi_*\alpha \wedge \beta = \pi_*(\alpha\wedge \pi^*\beta)  
	\] 
		\item If $\alpha \in \Omega_{cv}(E)$ and $\beta\in \Omega_{c}(B)$,
			\[
			\int_B \pi_*\alpha \wedge \beta = \int_E \alpha\wedge \pi^*\beta
			\] 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	(a) Write $\alpha = f(x,t) dt_1\wedge\cdots\wedge dt_m\wedge \pi^*\eta $
	in terms of local coordinates on $E|_U$. Then 
	\[
	\pi_*(\alpha\wedge \pi^*\beta)
	= \int_{\pi^{-1}(b)}f(x,t) dt_1\wedge\cdots\wedge dt_m \wedge
	\pi^*(\eta\wedge \beta)
	= \pi_*(\alpha) \wedge \beta
	\] 
	(b) It suffices to prove this on a trivialising subset $E|_U$. Let 
	$U\times V_\alpha$ 
	is an open cover of this subset such that 
	that the manifold structure of the fiber is trivial, 
	where $U \subset B, V\subset F$. After summing over the partition of unity, 
	the result will still hold. The integral can be written
	\begin{align*}
		\int_{E|_U} \alpha\wedge \pi^*\beta 
		&= \sum_\alpha\int_{U \times V_\alpha}\alpha\wedge \pi^*\beta \\
		&= \sum_\alpha\int_{U}\int_{V_\alpha}\alpha\wedge \pi^*\beta \\
		&= \int_{U}\int_{\pi^{-1}(b)}\alpha\wedge \pi^*\beta \\
		&= \int_{U}\pi_*\alpha \wedge \beta 
	\end{align*}
	where we have applied Fubini's theorem in the second line, and the result of
	part (a) in the last line.
\end{proof}


For an orientable vector bundle $\pi:E\to M$ of rank $n$ over a manifold $M$ 
with a finite good cover, it can be shown that  $H_c^*(E)\simeq H_c^{*-n}(M)$.\cite[Prop
6.13]{bott_tu} 
% TODO should I formulate Thom isomorphism only for finite good cover manifolds,
% in particular compact manifolds

\begin{thm}[Thom Isomorphism] % Thm 6.17 Bott Tu
	If a vector bundle $\pi: E \to M$ is orientable with rank $n$, and $M$ has a
	finite good cover, then 
	 $H^*_{cv}(E) \simeq H^{*-n}(M)$
\end{thm}
\begin{defn}
	Under the Thom isomorphism $\mathcal{F}:H^*(M)\to H_{cv}^{*+n}(E)$, the
	image of $1\in H^0(M)$ is called the \underline{Thom class}  $\Phi\in
	H_{cv}^n(E)$ of the vector bundle.
\end{defn}



\section{Mathai-Quillen construction of Thom form}
\label{section:mq_formula}
The Mathai-Quillen construction uses a slight variation of the Thom isomorphism.
Differential forms with compact support in each fibre are replaced by forms
which are rapidly decreasing in the fibre directions. 

\begin{defn}
	A differential form $\omega\in \Omega(E)$ is \underline{rapidly decreasing
	along the fiber} if  $\omega_x$ is in Schwartz space
\end{defn}

Using the diffeomorphism $h : E \to E$ taking the unit ball to $\mathbb{R}^n$
\[
	h(y) = \frac{y}{\sqrt{1-\abs{y^2}} }
\] 
we can pull back a rapidly decreasing form to a smooth form which is supported
on the unit ball bundle. 
All derivatives must approach zero as $y \to 1$


Let us first look at the construction on an oriented Euclidean vector bundle
$E\xrightarrow{\pi} M$ of rank $n$ over a point $M=\{x_0\}$. 
Given coordinates $x^1,\ldots,x^n$ on $E$ from the local trivialisation,
a Thom form $U\in \Omega^n_{cv}(E)$ can be defined as
\[
	U(x) = (2\pi)^{-n/2}e^{-\abs{x}^2 /2} dx^1\wedge \ldots\wedge dx^n
\] 
Given the basis $e_1,\ldots,e_n$ of  $V$ corresponding to the coordinates
$x^1,\ldots,x^n$, denote the map $dx = dx^k \otimes e_k \in 
\Omega^1(E, V)$. Then $e^{-idx}\in \Omega(E,\bigwedge V)$ by taking a formal sum
of wedge products.
We can express this form in terms of the Berezin integral,
considered as a map $\int^B := \int \odif{e_1}\cdots\odif{e_n} 
: \Omega^*(E,\bigwedge V) \to \Omega^*(E)$.

\begin{lem} \label{lem:gaussian_integral} %1.49 BGV
	The form $U\in \Omega^n_{cv}(E)$ equals 
	\[
		 U(x) = (2\pi)^{-n/2} e^{-\abs{x}^2 /2} \epsilon(n)\int^B e^{-idx}
	\] 
	where $\epsilon(n)=1$ if  $n$ is even, otherwise  $i$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	The Berezin integral kills any forms of order less than $n$, so only
	multiples of $e_1 \wedge \ldots\wedge e_n$ remain.
	Hence,
	\begin{align*}
		\int^B e^{-idx} 
		&= (-i)^n \frac{1}{n!}\int^B (dx^k\otimes e_k)^n \\
		&= (-i)^n \int^B (dx^1\otimes e_1) \ldots(dx^n\otimes e_n) \\
		&= (-i)^n(-1)^{n(n-1)/2} \int^B dx^1\wedge \ldots\wedge dx^n\otimes e_1 \wedge\ldots\wedge e_n \\
		&= (-i)^n(-1)^{n(n-1)/2} dx^1\wedge \ldots\wedge dx^n
	\end{align*}
	Multiplication of elements of $\Omega(E,\bigwedge V)$ occur in
	the graded tensor product, so that this is a graded algebra. 
	In the second line, we have permuted all $n!$ terms into standard order, and
	terms of degree two commute.
	In the third line, $dx^i$ are separated from the  $e_i$, which
	anti-commute due to  $\Omega(E,\bigwedge V)$ being a graded algebra. 
	The lemma now follows, since
	$(-i)^n(-1)^{n(n-1)/2}$ equals 1 if $n$ is even, and otherwise  $-i$. 
\end{proof}
We will define the Thom form on a more general manifold by modification of the
above lemma. Denote $x \in \Omega^0(E,\pi^*E)$ as the \underline{tautological
section}, defined by $e\in E_p \mapsto e\in (\pi^*E)_{e} = E_{p}$.
Then choosing a Euclidean connection $\nabla^E$ on  $E$, we may replace  $dx$ by 
$\nabla^{\pi^*E} x \in \Omega^1(E,\pi^*E)$.

\begin{prop} \label{prop:derivative_berezin} %1.50 BGV
	If $\nabla$ is a metric connection on  $E$, this induces a covariant
	derivative on $\bigwedge E$. Then for any
	$\alpha\in\Omega(M,\bigwedge E)$, we have 
	\[
	d\int^B \alpha = \int^B \nabla\alpha
	\] 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} 
	Given a non-vanishing section $\nu\in \Omega^1(M,\bigwedge^nE)$,
	the Berezin integral is given by the induced inner product on $\bigwedge E$
	with  $\nu$. Then  $\nabla$ induced on  $\bigwedge E$ is compatible with
	this inner product, and 
	\[
	d\gen{\nu,\omega} = \gen{\nabla \nu, \omega} + \gen{\nu, \nabla \omega}
	=\int^B \nabla\omega
	\] 
	where we have used the fact that $\nabla \nu = 0$, by definition of the
	Berezin integral on an oriented vector bundle with a metric connection.
\end{proof}

We will apply this proposition to the pullback vector bundle $\pi^*E \to E$, 
with induced connection $\nabla^{\pi^*E}=\pi^*\nabla^E$. Denote $V=\pi^*E$ to
simplify notation.
Let $\iota(s):\Omega^i(E,\bigwedge^j V) \to
\Omega^i(E,\bigwedge^{j-1} V)$ for $s\in\Gamma(V)$ be a contraction operator
defined in a similar fashion as \ref{def:contraction}, by the following
properties:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item If $w\in \Omega^0(E,V)$, then  $\iota(s)w = \gen{s,w}$
	\item If $\alpha\in\Omega^i(E,\bigwedge^jV),
		\beta\in\Omega^k(E,\bigwedge^lV)$, then 
	 \[
	\iota(x)(\alpha\wedge \beta) 
	= (\iota(x)\alpha)\wedge\beta + (-1)^{i+j}\alpha\wedge(\iota(x)\beta)
	\] 
\end{enumerate}
Note that this uniquely defines $\iota(s)$ because the formulas can be applied
to a basis of $\bigwedge^iT^*E\otimes \bigwedge^jV$.

Denote $\nabla = \nabla^{\pi^*E}$. 
Recall that the curvature is a form in $\Omega^2(E,\End(V))$ 
which is skew-symmetric valued. We can identify $\mathfrak{so}(V)$ with 
$\bigwedge^2 V$ in the following way:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:so_wedge}
	A\in \mathfrak{so}(V) \mapsto \sum_{i<j} \gen{Ae_i,e_j} e_i\wedge e_j
\end{equation}
given a frame of $V$. Hence, we denote the curvature form as $F \in
\Omega^2(E,\bigwedge^2V)$.

\begin{prop} \label{prop:closed_prop} % 1.51 BGV
	Let $x \in \Omega^0(V)$ be the tautological section on $E$, and $\nabla$ the
	induced connection on $\bigwedge V$.
	Let $\omega_t = \frac{1}{2}t^2\abs{x}^2 + it\nabla x + F 
	\in \Omega(E,\bigwedge V)$. Then 
	\[
		(\nabla - it\iota(x))\omega_t = 0
	\] 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	 By metric compatibility,
	$\nabla \abs{x}^2 = 2\gen{\nabla x, x} = -2\iota(x)\nabla x$.
	Next, we have $\nabla(\nabla x) = \iota(x) F$.
	Finally by Bianchi's identity, $\nabla F = 0$. Combining this,
	\[
	\nabla \omega_t = -t^2\iota(x) \nabla x + it\iota(x)F 
	\] 
	On the other hand, $\iota(x)\abs{x}^2 = 0$ by definition of $\iota(x)$, so
	\[
	it\iota(x)\omega_t = -t^2\iota(x) \nabla x + it\iota(x)F
	\] 
\end{proof}

We now define the Mathai-Quillen Thom form 
\begin{equation}
	U = (2\pi)^{-n/2}\epsilon(N) \int^B e^{-\frac{1}{2}\abs{x}^2-i\nabla x - F} \in \Omega^n(E)
\end{equation}
and its parameterised version $U_t = (2\pi)^{-n/2}\epsilon(N) \int^B e^{-\omega_t} \in
\Omega^n(E)$. To justify why $U_t\in\Omega^n(E)$, note that
$\omega_t\in\bigoplus_{i=0}^2 \Omega^i(E,\bigwedge^iV)$, and hence 
$e^{-\omega_t} \in \bigoplus_{i=0}^n \Omega^i(E,\bigwedge^iV)$. The Berezin
integral then only retains the top degree part. 

\begin{thm}
	The Mathai-Quillen form $U \in \Omega^n_{rd}(E)$ is a Thom form. 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	% BGV Lemma 1.51
	We need to show that $U$ is closed, and integration along the fiber gives $1\in
	\Omega^0(E)$.
	From equation (\ref{eq:grassman_exp}), the exponential of $-\omega_t$
	can be written 
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:MQ_exp}
		e^{-\omega_t} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{e^{-t^2\abs{x}^2 /2}}{k!} (-it\nabla x
		- F)^k 
		= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k!} (-\omega_t)^k
	\end{equation}
	Since $\nabla - it\iota(x)$ is an antiderivation, it follows from
	Proposition \ref{prop:closed_prop} that $(\nabla-it\iota(x)) e^{-\omega_t} =
	0$. 
	We can extend Proposition \ref{prop:derivative_berezin} to 
	$d\int^B\alpha = \int^B (\nabla-it\iota(s))\alpha$ for any	
	$\alpha\in\Omega(\bigwedge V)$ since $\iota(s)\alpha$ has no component in 
	the top exterior power.	
	Therefore it follows that $U_t \propto \int^B e^{-\omega_t}$ is closed.
	
	% BGV prop 1.52 says integral reduces to the case where $M$ is a point
	% Proof is found from Blau 
	From equation (\ref{eq:MQ_exp}), we can write the Thom form as 
	\[
	U_t = (2\pi)^{-n/2}\epsilon(N) e^{-\frac{1}{2}\abs{x}^2}\int^B e^{-i\nabla x -F}
	\] 
	To integrate $U_t \in \Omega(E)$ along the fiber of $V=\pi^*E$, we extract from
	the Berezin integral the part which is a $n$-form on the fiber of $V$,
	\begin{align*}
		\int_E (2\pi)^{-n/2}\epsilon(N) e^{-\frac{1}{2}\abs{x}^2}\int^B e^{-i\nabla x -F}
		&= (2\pi)^{-n/2}\epsilon(N) \int_E e^{-\frac{1}{2}\abs{x}^2}\int^B 
		e^{-idx}
		= 1 
	\end{align*}
	we are only left with the $dx$ term because the induced connection and
	curvature forms on  $\pi^*E$ do not have any components along the fiber.
	We have evaluated the integral using Lemma \ref{lem:gaussian_integral}.
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{comment} % Blau approach
Let $E=P\times_\rho V$ be the associated bundle to $P$ with rank $2m$. 
basic forms on $P\times V$ are in correspondence with forms on  $E$.

A representative for the Thom class, called the Mathai-Quillen Thom form, is
given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:mathai_quillen}
\Phi_\nabla(E) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^m} e^{-v_a^2/2} \int \odif{\chi} 
\exp(\chi_a\Omega^{ab}\chi_b /2 + i\nabla v^a \chi_a)
\end{equation}
where $v^a \in \Omega^0(P\times V)$ are coordinates on $V$, and $\nabla v^a \in
\Omega^1(P\times V)$ is the exterior covariant derivative of $v^a$.
Not well defined globally, since using trivialisation to use coordinates? 

We claim that this defines a basic form in $\Omega^{2m}_\rho(P\times V)$,
and that it is a representative of the Thom class. 

To show that it is a basic form, we need to prove it is horizontal and $\rho$
equivariant.  

To show that is is a representative of the Thom class, we need to prove it is
closed and satisfies  $\pi^*\Phi_\nabla(E) = 1$.

\section{Universal Mathai-Quillen formula}
\begin{prop}
	Let $E\to M$ be an oriented vector bundle with fiber $V=\mathbb{R}^n$ 
	and  $P=\Fr_{\SO}(E)$ be the
	principal $\SO(n)$-bundle of orthonormal oriented frames on  $E$. Then 
	$P\times_{\SO(n)} V$ is canonically isomorphic to $E$ as a vector bundle. 
\end{prop} 
\begin{proof}
	The action of $A\in\SO(n)$ on $P\times V$ is 
	$
		([v_1 \cdots v_n], v) \cdot A = ([v_1 \cdots v_n] A, A^{-1} v) 
	$.
	Then the canonical isomorphism $\psi : P\times_{\SO(n)} V \to E$ is defined by
	\[
		[[v_1 \cdots v_n], v] \mapsto [v_1 \cdots v_n] v
	\] 
	It is clear that this is well defined, linear, smooth and preserves the
	fiber. The map is injective because $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ must be linearly
	independent, and surjective because $v_1,\ldots,v_n$ is a basis for $E_x$.

Let $E\to M$ be an oriented vector bunde or rank  $n$ with a
metric and compatible connection, and fiber $V$. 
Let $P=\Fr_{\SO}(E)$, so 
$E$ can be identified as the associated bundle $P\times_G V$ with the
induced connection. 

More generally, let $G$ be a connected Lie group and 
consider a principal $G$-bundle  $P\to M$ over a manifold of
dimension $n$ with a connection. Let $\rho : G \to \SO(V)$ be a representation 
on a vector bundle of rank  $n$. 
This determines the associated vector bundle  $E:=P\times_\rho V \to M$
with typical fiber $V$.

A few remarks are necessary to explain the diagram.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
The injection $i:\Omega(P)\otimes\Omega(V) \to \Omega(P\times V)$ can be defined
as follows. Denote by $p_1 : P\times V \to P$ and $p_2:P\times V \to V$ the 
canonical projections. Then the map is defined by $\omega \otimes \alpha
\mapsto p_1^*\omega \wedge p_2^*\alpha$.  

\item 
Since $w$ is a  $\mathfrak{g}$-dga morphism, so is  
$w:\Omega(\mathfrak{g})\otimes\Omega(V)\to \Omega(P)\otimes\Omega(V)$ because it
is the identity on  $\Omega(V)$. We claim that $i$ is also a $\mathfrak{g}$-dga morphism. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Graded algebra homomorphism. It is linear by construction. It also respects
		multiplication because 
	\begin{align*}
		i((\omega_1\otimes\alpha_1)(\omega_2\otimes\alpha_2))
		&= i((-1)^{\abs{\alpha_1}\abs{\omega_2}}
		(\omega_1\wedge\omega_2)\otimes(\alpha_1\wedge \alpha_2)) \\
		&= (-1)^{\abs{\alpha_1}\abs{\omega_2}}
		p_1^*(\omega_1\wedge\omega_2)\wedge p_2^*(\alpha_1\wedge \alpha_2) \\
		&= (-1)^{\abs{\alpha_1}\abs{\omega_2}}p_1^*\omega_1\wedge
		p_1^*\omega_2\wedge p_2^*\alpha_1\wedge p_2^*\alpha_2  \\
		&= p_1^*\omega_1\wedge p_2^*\alpha_1 \wedge p_1^*\omega_2\wedge p_2^*\alpha_2 \\
		&= i(\omega_1\otimes \alpha_1)\wedge i(\omega_2\otimes \alpha_2) 
	\end{align*}
	\item Commutes with $d$ and $\iota_X$. This follows from by expanding the
		definitions of $d$ and  $\iota_X$ on the tensor product, given in
		equations (\ref{eq:tensor_ops}), and the fact that the pullbacks
		$p_1^*$ and $p_2^*$ commute with  $d$ and $\iota_X$.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, $w \circ i$ is a $\mathfrak{g}$-dga morphism and descends to the map
 $\overline{w}$ on the basic subcomplexes.
\end{itemize}

Let $V$ be a real vector space with standard inner product, and $\rho : G \to
\SO(V)$ be a rep of the Lie group $G$, with induced rep $\rho_* :
\mathfrak{g}\to \so(V)$.
We will construct a form in $S(\mathfrak{g}^*)\otimes \Omega(V) \otimes
\bigwedge V$, which we will apply the Berezin integral to, followed by the
Cartan map.  Fix an oriented orthonormal basis $\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$ for
$V$, which allows us to define the Berezin integral, with corresponding
coordinate functions $x_1,\ldots,x_n$.   
Let  $\{X_1,\ldots,X_m\}$ be a basis of $\mathfrak{so}(V)$, with corresponding
dual basis $\{u_1,\ldots,u_m\}$ where $m= \frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$. Recall that we 
can identify $\mathfrak{so}(V)$ with 
$\bigwedge^2 V$ via equation (\ref{eq:so_wedge}), restated here 
\[
	X_a \in\mathfrak{so}(V) \mapsto \sum_{i<j}\gen{X_a e_i,e_j} e_i\wedge e_j
	= \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i} e_i\wedge X_a e_i
\] 
Denote $dx := \sum_i dx_i \otimes e_i \in \Omega^1(V)\otimes V$. Define the element 
\begin{equation} % 7.16 guillemin % cordes eq 11.13 % naber 3.18
	\label{eq:universal_thom_exponent}
	\sigma := -\frac{1}{2}\abs{x}^2 - idx 
	- \sum_a u_a\rho_* \otimes X_a 
	\quad \in S(\g^*) \otimes \Omega(V) \otimes \bigwedge V
\end{equation}
which is analogous to $\omega_1$ as defined in Prop \ref{prop:closed_prop}.
Note that $u_a \rho_* \in \mathfrak{g}^*$.
In components, if we let $M^a = [\gen{ X_ae_i,e_j}]_{ji}$, we can write the same
element as 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:universal_thom_exponent2}
\sigma = -\frac{1}{2}\abs{x}^2 - i\sum_i dx_i\otimes e_i 
	-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j} (\rho_*)_{ji}e_i\wedge e_j
\end{equation}
since $u_aX_a$ is the identity on  $\so(V)$, and $(\rho_*)_{ji} \in \mathfrak{g}^*$.
Consider its Berezin integral
\begin{equation} \label{eq:universal_thom}
	U := \epsilon(n)(2\pi)^{-n /2}\int^B \exp\paren{\sigma}  
	\quad\in S(\g^*)\otimes \Omega(V)
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon(n)=1$ if $n$ is even and otherwise $\epsilon(n)=i$.

\begin{thm} \label{thm:uinversal_Thom}
	The element $U \in S(\mathfrak{g}^*) \otimes \Omega(V)$ defined above  
	is a universal Thom form.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof} % Guillemin p86-87
We need to show that it is invariant and
equivariantly closed in the Cartan model, and integration along the
fiber gives 1. 


(1) Closed. 
We can consider the Cartan
differential $\delta_C = d - \sum u_k\iota_k$ as an operator on 
$S(\so(V)^*)\otimes\Omega(V)\otimes\bigwedge V$ by acting trivially on
the last factor, so that it commutes with the Berezin integral. 
It suffices to show $U$ is closed as a form on  $S(\so(V)^*)\otimes \Omega(V)$,
because the map  $\rho^* : S(\so(V)^*)\to S(\g^*)$ given by  $u_i\mapsto
u_i\circ \rho_*$ commutes with the Cartan differential. This can be seen most
easily by viewing the elements as polynomials as in Theorem
\ref{thm:cartan_diff}, which shows that  $(\delta_C \rho_* \alpha)(X) 
= (\rho_*\delta_C \alpha)(\rho(X)) = (d-\iota_{\rho(X)})\alpha(\rho(X))$, noting
that $\iota_X$ and  $\iota_{\rho(X)}$ act the same way on $\Omega(V)$.

For the first term, only $d$ acts to give $\delta_C \abs{x}^2 = 2x_i dx_i$.
On the second term, $d^2=0$ and we need to evaluate $u_a\iota_a dx_i$. 
Since $x_i$ projects to the $i$th component of a vector in $V$, and the action
of $e^{tX_k}$ is a matrix multiplication, for $v\in V$ in the tangent space
\begin{align} \label{eq:interior_dx}
	\iota_a dx_i(v)
	= d x_i \paren{\odv{}{t}_{t=0} e^{-tX_a} v} 
	= -x_i \paren{X_a v} 
\end{align}
Hence, $u_a\iota_a dx_i = -u_a\otimes x_i \circ X_a$. The third term is a
multiple of $u_i$ and constant on $\Omega(V)$,
hence maps to zero by  $\delta_C$. Thus, 
\begin{align}
	(d-u_a\iota_a) \sigma 
&= -x_i dx_i - u_a \otimes i x_iX_a \otimes e_i \nonumber \\
&= -x_i dx_i - u_a \otimes i x_j \otimes X_a e_j 
\end{align}
which is justified by $x_j$ being the coordinate functions of $e_j$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:move_operator_tensor}
x_i X_a \otimes e_i 
= \gen{X_ae_j,e_i}x_j \otimes e_i 
= x_j \otimes \gen{X_ae_j,e_i}e_i 
= x_j \otimes X_a e_j 
\end{equation}
The key observation is that $\delta_C$ acts by lowering the degree of the
$\bigwedge V$ part. More precisely, consider the action of the Berezin
derivative/integral
\begin{align*}
\pdv{}{e_k} \paren{-\sum_{i<j} u_a\otimes e_i\wedge M^a_{ji}e_j}
&= -\sum_{i>k} u_a\otimes M^a_{ik}e_i + 
 \sum_{i<k} u_a\otimes M^a_{ki}e_i \\
&= -\sum_{i} u_a\otimes M^a_{ik}e_i  
= -u_a\otimes X_a e_k  
\end{align*}
since $M^a_{ij}=-M^a_{ji}$. Applying $\pdv{}{e_k}$ to the other term,
\[
\pdv{}{e_k} (-idx_i \otimes e_i) = idx_k
\] 
because $e_i$ anti-commutes with  $dx_i$. We have shown that
\begin{equation}
\delta_C \sigma = \paren{\sum_{k} ix_k \pdv{}{e_k}}\sigma
\end{equation}
It follows that this also holds for $\exp (\sigma)$, because  $\delta_C$ is an
anti-derivation. Therefore, 
\[
\delta_C \int^B \exp(\sigma) 
= \int^B \delta_C \exp(\sigma)
= \int^B ix_k \pdv{}{e_k} \exp(\sigma) = 0
\] 
as the Berezin derivative kills any top degree terms in $\bigwedge V$.

(2) Integral along the fiber. We need to extract the coefficient of $dx_1\wedge
\ldots\wedge dx_n$. Therefore, the last term in $\sigma$ does not contribute,
and 
 \[
	 \int_V U = \epsilon(n)(2\pi)^{-n /2}\int_V e^{-\abs{x}^2} \int^B \exp(-idx_k \otimes e_k) 
\] 
But we know $\int^Be^{-idx_k\otimes e_k}$ evaluates to 
$(-i)^n(-1)^{n(n-1)/2} dx_1\wedge \ldots\wedge dx_n$ by Lemma
\ref{lem:gaussian_integral}. Hence, the integral of $U$ along the fiber $V$ is 1.

(3) Invariant. % proved in p27 Constantinecu PhD
It suffices to show the terms in $\sigma$ are invariant, because
the Lie derivative is a derivation. We can extend the action of $G$ to the
graded algebra $S(\g^*)\otimes \Omega(V)\otimes \bigwedge V$,
acting on the $\bigwedge V$ component by multiplication by $\rho(g)^{-1}$. 
Note that the Berezin integral is
invariant under the action on $\bigwedge V$. This gives an associated Lie derivative,
corresponding to multiplication by $\rho_*(X)$ for  $X\in\mathfrak{g}$.

It is clear that $\abs{x}^2$ is invariant, because $\rho(g)$ has determinant 1.
Next, we show $dx_i\otimes e_i$ is invariant by applying $\mathcal{L}_X$,
\[
\mathcal{L}_X (dx_i\otimes e_i) = \iota_X(dx_i) \otimes e_i + dx_i \otimes
\rho_*(X)e_i = 0
\] 
by equations (\ref{eq:interior_dx}) and (\ref{eq:move_operator_tensor}).
Finally, to apply $\mathcal{L}_X$, recall that the action on $S(\g^*)$ 
is the coadjoint representation $\mathcal{L}_X \alpha(Y) = -\alpha ([X,Y])$. 
The action on $V$ is  $\mathcal{L}_X v = \rho_*(X)v$.
We can denote the third term in $\sigma$
as $\frac{1}{2}e_i\wedge (\rho_*)_{ji} e_j \in \g^*\otimes \bigwedge^2V$,
since $u_aX_a$ is just the identity.
For $X,Y\in\g$, with  $\rho_*(X)=A,\rho_*(Y)=B$,
\begin{align*}
	&\quad\;(\mathcal{L}_X(e_i \wedge (\rho_*)_{ji} e_j))(Y) \\
	&= (A e_i \wedge \rho_* e_i)(Y)
	- e_i \wedge \rho_*([X,Y]) e_i
	+ (e_i \wedge \rho_* A e_i)(Y) \\
	&= Ae_i \wedge B e_i
	- e_i \wedge (AB-BA) e_i
	+ e_i \wedge A Be_i \tag{$\star$} \\
	&= -e_i \wedge BA e_i
	- e_i \wedge (AB-BA) e_i
	+ e_i \wedge AB e_i = 0\tag{$\star\star$}
\end{align*}
where we begin by using the derivation property of $\mathcal{L}_X$, and explain
the next two lines below.

Proof of ($\star$): This step initially looks wrong, but recall that the term is
to be interpreted as 
\[
\sum_{i,j}e_i\wedge (\rho_*(Y))_{ji} (Ae_j)
=\sum_{i,j}e_i\wedge \sum_kB_{ji} A_{kj}e_k
=\sum_{i}e_i\wedge \sum_{k,j}A_{kj}B_{ji} e_k
=\sum_{i}e_i\wedge AB e_i
\] 
Proof of ($\star\star$): This is just an application of the more general property
\[
Ae_i \wedge Be_i
= A_{ji}e_j \wedge B_{ki}e_k
= e_j \wedge B_{ki}A^\intercal_{ij}e_k
= e_j \wedge BA^\intercal e_j 
\] 
Finally, $U$ is invariant because $\mathcal{L}_X$ commutes with the Berezin
integral.
\end{proof}

The proof of (1) closure is due to \citet{guillemin} and part of (3) invariance
is a corrected version of the proof in \citet[p.27]{constantinescu}. In
particular, the steps $(\star)$ and  $(\star\star)$ are corrected, as well as
the action of $\mathcal{L}_X$ on $\mathfrak{g}^*$. 

\begin{remark}
	The minus sign in $e^{-tX_a}$ in the fundamental vector field over $V$ in
	equation (\ref{eq:interior_dx}) arises due to the fact that the
	$\SO(V)$-action on $V$ is a right action. In general, this is so that the
	map $\g \to \Gamma(TM)$ is a Lie algebra homomorphism. 
\end{remark}	
 
% TODO prove equivalence to usual form
To relate our formula to other versions in literature, let $\chi =
(e_1,\ldots,e_n)$ be the Grassman variables for $V$. 
In more compact notation, the third term of $\sigma$ can be written  
as $\frac{1}{2} e_i \wedge (\rho_*)_{ij} e_j = \frac{1}{2} \chi^\intercal
(\rho_*) \chi$. Then the Mathai-Quillen Thom form 
$U\in S(\mathfrak{g}^*)\otimes \Omega(V)$ can be alternatively written as 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:universal_thom_form} % AJ 2.1
	U = \epsilon(n)(2\pi)^{-n /2}e^{-\abs{x}^2} 
	\int^B \exp \paren{\frac{1}{2}\chi^{\intercal}(\rho_*)\chi -
idx^{\intercal}\chi} \odif{\chi} 
\end{equation}
If $\rho_*(X)\in\so(V)$ is always invertible, we can apply
Proposition \ref{prop:berezin_formula}, to get
\[
	U = \epsilon(n)(2\pi)^{-n/2} \Pf(\rho_*) \exp(-\abs{x}^2-dx^{\intercal} (\rho_*)^{-1}dx)
\] 
We can also obtain a universal Thom form in the Weil model, by 
applying the Weil-Cartan isomorphism $(S(\mathfrak{g}^*)\otimes \Omega(V))^G
\xrightarrow{\simeq}(W(\mathfrak{g})\otimes \Omega(V))_{bas}$.

\section{Localisation}
One of the primitive applications of the Mathai-Quillen formula is to prove the
Poincar\'e-Hopf theorem. 

Let $E\to M$ be a vector bundle over  $M$, and $v\in\Gamma(E)$ be a section of $E$.
At a zero $p\in M$ of  $v$, the Lie bracket gives an endomorphism 
$\mathcal{L}_p(v) : T_pM \to T_pM$ defined by  $X\mapsto [X,v]$. In a coordinate system in
which  $p=0$ and  $v= v^i \partial_i$,  $\mathcal{L}_p(v)$ is given by 
 \[
	 \mathcal{L}_p(v)\partial_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n} [\partial_i, v^j(p)\partial^j] 
	 = \sum_{j=1}^{n} (\partial_i v_j(p)) \partial_j
\] 
A zero of $p$ is called \underline{non-degenerate} if  $\mathcal{L}_p(v)$ is
invertible. Denote by $\nu(p,v) \in \{\pm 1\}$ the sign of the determinant of
$\mathcal{L}_p(v)$. If all of the zeroes of $v$ are non-degenerate, we call  $v$
non-degenerate. 

\begin{thm}[Poincare-Hopf] % Thm 1.56 BGV
	If $v$ is a non-degenerate vector field on an oriented compact manifold $M$ 
	of dimension $n$, then 
	\[
		 \int_M \chi(TM) = \sum_{\set{p|v(p)=0}} \nu(p,v)	
	\] 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	(adapted from \cite[Theorem 1.56]{bgv})
	Choose a chart $\phi_p : U_p \to \mathbb{R}^n$ in a neighbourhood $U_p$ of
	each zero $p\in M$ of $v$, which gives coordinates on the tangent bundle 
	$\psi_p : TU_p \to \mathbb{R}^n$. The vector field $v$ defines a
	smooth map $\psi_p \circ v : U_p\to \mathbb{R}^n$ 
	with $v(p) = 0$ and invertible
	derivative $\mathcal{L}_p(v)$. 
	% TODO why is this the derivative?

	By the inverse function theorem, $v$ is a local diffeomorphism
	between open neighbourhoods $V_p \subset U_p$ and $B \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. 
	The orientation on $V_p$ induced by the oriented chart $\phi_p$ and by 
	the local diffeomorphism $\psi_p \circ v$ differ by the sign $\nu(p,v)$. 

	We may assume  $V_p$ are disjoint for each $p$.  Choose a Riemannian metric
	on $M$ which agrees with the metric on each $V_p$ induced by the diffeomorphism
	into  $\mathbb{R}^n$. Since $M$ is compact,  $\exists \epsilon > 0$ such
	that  $\norm{v} \geq \epsilon$ on the compact set  $M\setminus \bigcup_p V_p$,
	because if $\norm{v}$ can get arbitrarily close to 0, we would find a convergent
	subsequence in $M\setminus \bigcup_p V_p$ whose limit is a zero of $v$.  

	Let $U\in \Omega^n(TM)$ be the Mathai-Quillen Thom form of  $TM$ with respect to the
	Riemannian metric and associated Levi-Civita connection. 
	Let $f : \mathbb{R}_+ \to [0,1]$ be a smooth bump function such that $f(s)=1$
	if  $s < \epsilon^2 /4$ and $f(s)=0$ if  $s>\epsilon^2$. Then for all $t>0$
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:euler_zeroes}
			\int_M \chi(TM) = \int_M v_t^* U 
		= \int_M (1-f(\norm{v}^2))v_t^*U  + \int_M f(\norm{v}^2)v_t^*U
	\end{equation}
	where $v_t := tv$. From equation (\ref{eq:MQ_exp}), we see that
	$v_t^* U$ is of the form
	\[
		v_t^*U = e^{-t^2\norm{v}^2 /2} \sum_{k=0}^{n} t^k \alpha_k
	\] 
	where $\alpha_k \in \Omega(M)$. Therefore, the first integral in equation
	(\ref{eq:euler_zeroes}) is rapidly decreasing in $t$ since $\norm{v}^2 >
	\epsilon^2 /4$, and approaches zero as $t\to\infty$.

	On each $V_p$, the metric and connection are trivial since they are induced 
	by $v$. If we write $v= \sum_{i=1}^{n} x^i \partial_i$ in the coordinates of
	the chart $\psi_p$,
	\begin{align*}
		v_t^*U |_{V_p} 
		&= (2\pi)^{-n/2} e^{-t^2\norm{x}^2 /2} \int^B e^{-itdv} \\
		&= (2\pi)^{-n/2} \nu(p,v) e^{-t^2\norm{x}^2 /2} t^n dx^1 \wedge
		\ldots\wedge dx^n \tag{using Lemma \ref{lem:gaussian_integral}}
	\end{align*}
	The sign $\nu(p,v)$ comes from the Berezin integral using the orientation of
	the manifold, while $x^1,\ldots,x^n$ are coordinates of the vector field. 
	Therefore, 
	\begin{align*}
		\lim_{t \to \infty} \int_{V_p} f(\norm{v}^2)v_t^*U 
		&= (2\pi)^{-n/2} \nu(p,v) 
		\lim_{t \to \infty} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}
		f(\norm{x}^2) e^{-t^2\norm{x}^2 /2} t^n dx^1 \wedge \ldots\wedge dx^n\\
		&= (2\pi)^{-n/2} \nu(p,v) 
		\lim_{t \to \infty} \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} 
		f(\norm[*]{t^{-1}y}^2) e^{-\norm{y}^2 /2} dy^1 \wedge \ldots\wedge dy^n\\
		&= \nu(p,v) 
	\end{align*}
	where we have made the change of variables $x=t^{-1}y$. Summing over each of
	the neighbourhoods $V_p$ of zeroes, we get the result.
\end{proof}

There is a generalisation of this result, where we assume that the zeroes
of $v$ are isolated instead of non-degenerate.\cite[Theorem 1.58]{bgv} 

% p51 Bott Tu
To every closed (as a subspace) and oriented submanifold $i: S
\xhookrightarrow{} M$ of dimension  $k$, we can
associate a unique cohomology class  $[\eta_s]\in H^{n-k}(M)$ called its
\underline{Poincare dual} as follows. Let $\omega\in \Omega_c^k(M)$ be closed.
Since $\operatorname{supp}(\omega|_S) \subset \operatorname{supp}(\omega) \cap
S$ is a closed subset of a compact set, $i^*\omega$ also has compact support on
$S$, so  $\int_S i^*\omega$ is defined. Hence integration over  $S$ is a  
linear functional on $H^k_c(M)$. It follows by Poincare duality:
$(H_c^k(M))^*\simeq H^{n-k}(M)$, that integration over $S$ corresponds to a
unique cohomology class $[\eta_S]\in H^{n-k}(M)$. 
From the construction of the Poincare duality map, $\eta_S$ satisfies
for any closed $\omega\in \Omega^k_c(M)$
\[
\int_S i^*\omega = \int_M \omega \wedge \eta_S
\] 
\begin{defn}
	Let $S$ be a submanifold of dimension  $k$ in a manifold  $M$ of dimension

Let $S$ be an oriented submanifold of an oriented manifold $M$, which is closed
as a subspace. Let $j:T \hookrightarrow M$ be the inclusion
of a tubular neighborhood of  $S$. Since $S$ and  $M$ are orientable, the normal
bundle is also orientable. % TODO why?

	The Poincare dual of a submanifold $S^k \subset M^n$ is the Thom class of the
	normal bundle of $S$ in  $M$, i.e. 
	\[
		\int_M \omega\wedge j_*\Phi = \int_S i^*\omega 
	\] 
	for all $\omega\in H^k_c(M)$, and $\Phi\in H^{n-k}(T)$.

\begin{cor} \label{cor:vb_localisation} % prop 12.8 Bott Tu
	Let $E\to M$ be an oriented vector bundle of rank $k$ over an oriented 
	manifold of dimension $n$, 
	and $s\in\Gamma(M,E)$ be a section which is transverse to .
	Then for all $\omega\in \Omega^{n-k}_c(M)$,
	\[
	\int_M \omega \wedge s^* \Phi(E) =\int_{s^{-1}(0)} i^*\omega  
	\] 
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
% TODO where is transversality used 
% how transversality homotopy theorem does not require this
	This follows from choosing the section to be the orientation preserving map, and
	choosing the submanifold of $0\subset E$ to be the image of the zero section.
	Since $0\subset E$ is a diffeomorphic embedding of $M$ in $E$, and we have the
	exact sequence
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.6em]
		0 \arrow[r] & T0 \arrow[r] & TE|_0 \arrow[r] 
						& E \arrow[r] & 0
	\end{tikzcd}
	\]
	the normal bundle of  $0\subset E$ is  $E$ itself.
	Hence $\eta_0 = \Phi(E)$. 
\end{proof}

% discussion from Witten N matrix model 3.3, see also cordes 11.10.3
% TODO
There is an extension of the previous result for a section $s$ which is not
transverse to the zero section, but with constant rank so that $s^{-1}(0)$ is a
manifold. 

Let $E\to M$ be a vector bundle over a finite-dimensional compact manifold  $M$.
Let $s\in\Gamma(M,E)$ be a generic section and assuming $\dim M \geq \rank E$, 
$S=s^{-1}(0)$ is a submanifold with
Poincare dual $s^*\Phi(E)=\chi(E)$ by Corollary \ref{cor:vb_localisation}. 
By the rank-nullity theorem, we would have $\dim S = \rank M - \rank E$, but 
we wish to consider a non-generic section $s$ of a certain type with 
$\dim S > \dim(M)-\rank(E)$. 

\begin{thm}[Generalised localisation theorem]
	Let  $N\to S$ be the normal bundle of dimension
	$\dim(M)-\dim(S)$.  More like $N = \coker (\nabla s)$

	Let  $u\in\Gamma(S,N)$ be a generic section and
	$P=u^{-1}(0)$ which has Poincare dual $\chi(V')$. Since  $P\subset S \subset M$,
	we claim that $i(P)$ is Poincare dual to  $\chi(E)$.
\[
\int_M \chi(E\to M)\wedge \omega = \int_{S} i^*\omega \wedge \chi(N\to S)
\]
\end{thm}

 
Note that if $s$ is a generic section then  $\coker (\nabla s) = \{0\}$, which
reduces to Corollary \ref{cor:vb_localisation}.
