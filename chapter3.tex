\section{Introduction}
Topological quantum fields theories can be constructed based on the
Mathai-Quillen formalism. Although the main breakthroughs in these theories have
been provided in their formulation as twisted $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric
theories, this provides a useful geometric framework.\cite{TQFTbook}

In general, Witten type TQFTs are associated with a moduli problem characterized
by three basic data: fields, symmetries, and equations.
In the case of Donaldson-Witten theory, the configuration space is the space of
connections $\mathcal{A}$ on a bundle $E$, whose elements are fields 
$\phi$ over a four-manifold  $X$.  the group $\mathcal{G}$ is the group of gauge
transformations associated with $G$, so we are led to consider the quotient
space  $\mathcal{A}/\mathcal{G}$. Within this quotient, the moduli space is
defined by a set of equations $s(\phi)=0$, and the self-duality equations can be
regarded as sections of a bundle
$\mathcal{E}=\mathcal{A}\times_{\mathcal{G}}\Omega^{2,+}(X,g_E)$. (What does
this mean?)
 \[
 \mathcal{M} = \set{\phi\in \mathcal{A} \mid s(\phi)=0}/\mathcal{G}
\] 
In finite dimensions, the Mathai-Quillen formula gives an explicit differentiam
form representative of the Euler class. However it was noticed by Atiyah and
Jeffrey \cite{atiyahlagrangians} that the action principle of the theory can be
recovered by constructing the Euler class of $\mathcal{E}$ using an extension of
the Mathai-Quillen representative to the infinite-dimensional case. Conversely,
the Mathai-Quillen formalism makes possible to construct a cohomological field
theory starting from a moduli problem.

Recall that there are quite different approaches for calculating the Euler number
$\chi(X) = \chi(TX)$ of an oriented even dimensional manifold $X$. 
This first is topological, and counts
the signed isolated zeros of a vector field on $X$, via the Hopf theorem. The
second is differential geometric and represents  $\chi(X)$ as the integral over
$X$ of a density constructed from the curvature of a connection on $X$, via
the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. 

The Mathai-Quillen formula \cite{MQformula} is a more general formula which interpolates between
the two approaches. It relies on the construction of a form $\chi_{s,\nabla}(E)$ in
the Euler class which depends
on both a section  $s$ and connection  $\nabla$.  

\begin{thm}[Thom Isomorphism] % Thm 6.17 Bott Tu
	If a vector bundle $\pi: E \to M$ is orientable with rank $n$, 
	then 
	 $H^*_{cv}(E) \simeq H^{*-n}(M)$
\end{thm}
\begin{defn}
	Under the Thom isomorphism $\mathcal{F}:H^*(M)\to H_{cv}^{*+n}(E)$, the
	image of $1\in H^0(M)$ is called the \underline{Thom class}  $\Phi\in
	H_{cv}^n(E)$ of the vector bundle.
\end{defn}



\section{Construction of Thom form}
Let us first look at the construction on an oriented Euclidean vector bundle
$E\xrightarrow{\pi} M$ of rank $n$ over a point $M=\{x_0\}$. 
Given coordinates $x^1,\ldots,x^n$ on $E$ from the local trivialisation,
a Thom form $U\in \Omega^n_{cv}(E)$ can be defined as
\[
	U(x) = (2\pi)^{-n/2}e^{-\abs{x}^2 /2} dx^1\wedge \ldots\wedge dx^n
\] 
Given the basis $e_1,\ldots,e_n$ of  $V$ corresponding to the coordinates
$x^1,\ldots,x^n$, denote the map $dx = dx^k \otimes e_k \in 
\Omega^1(E, V)$. Then $e^{-idx}\in \Omega(E,\bigwedge V)$ by taking a formal sum
of wedge products.
We can express this form in terms of the Berezin integral,
considered as a map $\int^B := \int \odif{e_1}\cdots\odif{e_n} 
: \Omega^*(E,\bigwedge V) \to \Omega^*(E)$.

\begin{lem} %1.49 BGV
	The form $U\in \Omega^n_{cv}(E)$ equals 
	\[
		 U(x) = (2\pi)^{-n/2} e^{-\abs{x}^2 /2} \epsilon(n)\int^B e^{-idx}
	\] 
	where $\epsilon(n)=1$ if  $n$ is even, otherwise  $i$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	The Berezin integral kills any forms of order less than $n$, so only
	multiples of $e_1 \wedge \ldots\wedge e_n$ remain.
	Hence,
	\begin{align*}
		\int^B e^{-idx} 
		&= (-i)^n \frac{1}{n!}\int^B (dx^k\otimes e_k)^n \\
		&= (-i)^n \int^B dx^1\wedge \ldots\wedge dx^n\otimes e_1 \wedge\ldots\wedge e_n \\
		&= (-i)^n(-1)^{n(n-1)/2} \int^B dx^1\wedge \ldots\wedge dx^n\otimes e_n \wedge\ldots\wedge e_1 \\
		&= (-i)^n(-1)^{n(n-1)/2} dx^1\wedge \ldots\wedge dx^n
	\end{align*}
	In the second line, we have permuted all $n!$ terms into standard order for
	both the $dx^i$ and  $e_i$, so the signs of the permutations cancel.
	In the third line, we needed to reverse the order of the $e_i$ to accomodate
	the order of integration. The lemma now follows, since
	$(-i)^n(-1)^{n(n-1)/2}$ equals 1 if $n$ is even, and otherwise  $-i$. 
\end{proof}
We will define the Thom form on a more general manifold by modification of the
above lemma. Denote $x \in \Omega^0(E,\pi^*E)$ as the \underline{tautological
section}, defined by $e\in E_p \mapsto e\in (\pi^*E)_{e} = E_{p}$.
Then choosing a Euclidean connection $\nabla^E$ on  $E$, we may replace  $dx$ by 
$\nabla^{\pi^*E} x \in \Omega^1(E,\pi^*E)$.

\begin{prop} \label{prop:derivative_berezin} %1.50 BGV
	If $\nabla$ is a metric connection on  $E$, this induces a covariant
	derivative on $\bigwedge E$. Then for any
	$\alpha\in\Omega(M,\bigwedge E)$, we have 
	\[
	d\int^B \alpha = \int^B \nabla\alpha
	\] 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} 
	Given a non-vanishing section $\nu\in \Omega^1(M,\bigwedge^nE)$,
	the Berezin integral is given by the induced inner product on $\bigwedge E$
	with  $\nu$. Then  $\nabla$ induced on  $\bigwedge E$ is compatible with
	this inner product, and 
	\[
	d\gen{\nu,\omega} = \gen{\nabla \nu, \omega} + \gen{\nu, \nabla \omega}
	=\int^B \nabla\omega
	\] 
	where we have used the fact that $\nabla \nu = 0$, by definition of the
	Berezin integral on an oriented vector bundle with a metric connection.
\end{proof}

We will apply this proposition to the pullback vector bundle $\pi^*E \to E$, 
with induced connection $\nabla^{\pi^*E}=\pi^*\nabla^E$. Denote $V=\pi^*E$ to
simplify notation.
Let $\iota(s):\Omega^i(E,\bigwedge^j V) \to
\Omega^i(E,\bigwedge^{j-1} V)$ for $s\in\Gamma(V)$ be a contraction operator
defined in a similar fashion as \ref{def:contraction}, by the following
properties:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item If $w\in \Omega^0(E,V)$, then  $\iota(s)w = \gen{s,w}$
	\item If $\alpha\in\Omega^i(E,\bigwedge^jV),
		\beta\in\Omega^k(E,\bigwedge^lV)$, then 
	 \[
	\iota(x)(\alpha\wedge \beta) 
	= (\iota(x)\alpha)\wedge\beta + (-1)^{i+j}\alpha\wedge(\iota(x)\beta)
	\] 
\end{enumerate}
Note that this uniquely defines $\iota(s)$ because the formulas can be applied
to a basis of $\bigwedge^iT^*E\otimes \bigwedge^jV$.

Denote $\nabla = \nabla^{\pi^*E}$. 
Recall that the curvature is a form in $\Omega^2(E,\End(V))$ 
which is skew-symmetric valued. We can identify $\mathfrak{so}(V)$ with 
$\bigwedge^2 V$ in the following way:
\[
	A\in \mathfrak{so}(V) \mapsto \sum_{i<j} \gen{Ae_i,e_j} e_i\wedge e_j
\] 
given a frame of $V$. Hence, we denote the curvature form as $F \in
\Omega^2(E,\bigwedge^2V)$.

\begin{lem} % 1.51 BGV
	Let $x \in \Omega^0(V)$ be the tautological section on $E$, and $\nabla$ the
	induced connection on $\bigwedge V$.
	Let $\omega_t = \frac{1}{2}t^2\abs{x}^2 + it\nabla x + F 
	\in \Omega(E,\bigwedge V)$. Then 
	\[
		(\nabla - it\iota(x))\omega_t = 0
	\] 
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
	 By metric compatibility,
	$\nabla \abs{x}^2 = 2\gen{\nabla x, x} = -2\iota(x)\nabla x$.
	Next, we have $\nabla(\nabla x) = \iota(x) F$.
	Finally by Bianchi's identity, $\nabla F = 0$. Combining this,
	\[
	\nabla \omega_t = -t^2\iota(x) \nabla x + it\iota(x)F 
	\] 
	On the other hand, $\iota(x)\abs{x}^2 = 0$ by definition of $\iota(x)$, so
	\[
	it\iota(x)\omega_t = -t^2\iota(x) \nabla x + it\iota(x)F
	\] 
\end{proof}
We can also extend Proposition \ref{prop:derivative_berezin} to 
$d\int^B\alpha = \int^B (\nabla-it\iota(s))\alpha$ for any
$\alpha\in\Omega(\bigwedge V)$ since $\iota(s)\alpha$ has no component in the top exterior power.
% TODO 
why this means the Thom form is closed?

We now define the Thom form $U_t = \epsilon(N) \int^B e^{-\omega_t} \in
\Omega^n(E)$. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{comment} % Blau approach
Let $E=P\times_\rho V$ be the associated bundle to $P$ with rank $2m$. 
basic forms on $P\times V$ are in correspondence with forms on  $E$.

A representative for the Thom class, called the Mathai-Quillen Thom form, is
given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:mathai_quillen}
\Phi_\nabla(E) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^m} e^{-v_a^2/2} \int \odif{\chi} 
\exp(\chi_a\Omega^{ab}\chi_b /2 + i\nabla v^a \chi_a)
\end{equation}
where $v^a \in \Omega^0(P\times V)$ are coordinates on $V$, and $\nabla v^a \in
\Omega^1(P\times V)$ is the exterior covariant derivative of $v^a$.
Not well defined globally, since using trivialisation to use coordinates? 

We claim that this defines a basic form in $\Omega^{2m}_\rho(P\times V)$,
and that it is a representative of the Thom class. 

To show that it is a basic form, we need to prove it is horizontal and $\rho$
equivariant.  

To show that is is a representative of the Thom class, we need to prove it is
closed and satisfies  $\pi^*\Phi_\nabla(E) = 1$.

Pullback by zero section is Pfaffian.

\begin{prop} % prop 1.53 BGV
	We have the transgression formula
	\[
	\odv{}{t} U_t = -i\epsilon(N) d\int^B x e^{-\omega_t}
	\] 
\end{prop}
\begin{prop} \label{prop:thom_pullback}
	Let $s\in \Gamma(M,E)$ be a section of $E$.
	The cohomology class of the pullback $s^*\Phi_\nabla(E) \in \Omega^{n}(M)$
	is independent of the section  $s\in\Gamma(E)$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Integrating the transgression formula above from 0 to 1, 
	\[
		U_1 - U_0 = -id\int_0^1\int^B x e^{-t^2\abs{x}^2/2 +
		it\nabla x + F} \odif{t}
	\] 
	Note that $s^*U_0 = \epsilon(n)\int^B e^{-s^*F} \in \Omega(M)$. Since $F$ is
	the pullback curvature on $V = \pi^*E$, it is constant on 
	(why is $s^*U$ equal to the Pfaffian? use basis of V).

	Taking the pullback by $s$ on both sides, we find that $s^*U_1$ is
	cohomologous to the Euler class for any section $s$:  
	\[
		s^*U_1 - s^*U_0 = -id\int_0^1\int^B s\wedge e^{-t^2\abs{s}^2/2 +

of $v$ are isolated instead of $v$ being non-degenerate. 

% p51 Bott Tu
To every closed (as a subspace) and oriented submanifold $i: S
\xhookrightarrow{} M$ of dimension  $k$, we can
associate a unique cohomology class  $[\eta_s]\in H^{n-k}(M)$ called its
\underline{Poincare dual} as follows. Let $\omega\in \Omega_c^k(M)$ be closed.
Since $\operatorname{supp}(\omega|_S) \subset \operatorname{supp}(\omega) \cap
S$ is a closed subset of a compact set, $i^*\omega$ also has compact support on
$S$, so  $\int_S i^*\omega$ is defined. Hence integration over  $S$ is a  
linear functional on $H^k_c(M)$. It follows by Poincare duality:
$(H_c^k(M))^*\simeq H^{n-k}(M)$, that integration over $S$ corresponds to a
unique cohomology class $[\eta_S]\in H^{n-k}(M)$. 
From the construction of the Poincare duality map, $\eta_S$ satisfies
for any closed $\omega\in \Omega^k_c(M)$
\[
\int_S i^*\omega = \int_M \omega \wedge \eta_S
\] 
\begin{defn}
	Let $S$ be a submanifold of dimension  $k$ in a manifold  $M$ of dimension
	$n$. A \underline{tubular neighbourhood} of  $S$ in  $M$ is an open
	neighbourhood of  $S$ in  $M$ diffeomorphic to a vector bundle of rank
	$n-k$ over  $S$, such that  $S$ is diffeomorphic to the zero section.

	The \underline{normal bundle} of $S$ in  $M$ is the vector bundle on  $S$
	is the quotient bundle $N$ defined by the exact sequence

This follows from choosing the section to be the orientation preserving map, and
choosing the submanifold of $0\subset E$ to be the image of the zero section.
Since $0\subset E$ is a diffeomorphic embedding of $M$ in $E$, and we have the
exact sequence
\[
	\begin{tikzcd}[column sep = 1.6em]
		0 \arrow[r] & T0 \arrow[r] & TE|_0 \arrow[r]

the normal bundle of  $0\subset E$ is  $E$ itself.
Hence $\eta_0 = \Phi(E)$. 

\subsection{Witten localisation formula}
% discussion from Witten N matrix model 3.3, see also cordes 11.10.3
Let $E\to M$ be a vector bundle over a finite-dimensional compact manifold  $M$.
Let $s\in\Gamma(M,E)$ be a generic section and assuming $\dim M \geq \rank E$, 
$S=s^{-1}(0)$ is a submanifold with
Poincare dual $s^*\Phi(E)=\chi(E)$ by Corollary \ref{cor:vb_localisation}. 
By the rank-nullity theorem, we would have $\dim S = \rank M - \rank E$, but 
we wish to consider a non-generic section $s$ of a certain type with 
$\dim S > \dim(M)-\rank(E)$. 



Let  $N\to S$ be the normal bundle of dimension
$\dim(M)-\dim(S)$.  More like $N = \coker (\nabla s)$

Let  $u\in\Gamma(S,N)$ be a generic section and
$P=u^{-1}(0)$ which has Poincare dual $\chi(V')$. Since  $P\subset S \subset M$,
we claim that $i(P)$ is Poincare dual to  $\chi(E)$.
\[
\int_M \chi(E\to M)\wedge \omega = \int_{S} i^*\omega \wedge \chi(N\to S)
\] 
Note that if $s$ is a generic section then  $\coker (\nabla s) = \{0\}$, which
reduces to Corollary \ref{cor:vb_localisation}.

Let $E$ be an orientable vector bundle of rank  $2m$ with fiber  $V$. Given a
metric on  $E$, we can identify  $E$ as the associated bundle to the
$\SO(V)$-principal bundle of orthonormal oriented frames on $E$, that is, $E
\simeq \Fr_{\SO}(E) \times_{\SO(V)} V$. Denote $P=\Fr_{\SO}(E)$ and $G=\SO(V)$.

Then since  $P\times V \to P\times_G V \simeq E$ is a principal bundle,
$\Omega^*(E)\simeq \Omega^*(P\times V)_{bas}$. 
With a choice of Weil homomorphism $w:W(\mathfrak{g}) \to \Omega(P)$, we can
