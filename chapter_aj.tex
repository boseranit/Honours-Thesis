In finite dimensions, the Mathai-Quillen formula gives an explicit differential
form representative of the Euler class. 
It was shown by Atiyah and
Jeffrey \cite{atiyahlagrangians} that not only can the zero dimensional
Donaldson invariant can be identified with the Euler number of a vector bundle
over $\mathcal{A} /\mathcal{G}$, but the Donaldson invariants in general can be
written as an integral of a Mathai-Quillen type form over the gauge equivalence
classes of irreducible connections, similar to (reference Gauss-Bonnet formula
with Mathai-Quillen).
Moreover, they have been able to reproduce Witten's
action functional from twisted SUSY YM theory term by term from purely geometric
considerations.

Conversely,
the Mathai-Quillen formalism makes it possible to construct a cohomological field
theory starting from a moduli problem.

\section{Thom form analog for principal bundles}
Before we construct the Atiyah-Jeffrey formula, we first need to develop an
analog of the Thom form for a principal $G$-bundle $P\to M$. Assume $G$ is
a connected compact Lie group with $\dim G = d, \dim M = n$. 
We wish to construct a differential form  $W\in \Omega^d(P)$
such that its integral along the fiber equals 1, so that by 
Proposition \ref{prop:projection_formula}, for all $\beta\in \Omega_c^B(M)$
\begin{equation} \label{eq:principal_thom_local}
	\int_M \beta = \int_P \pi^*\beta \wedge W
\end{equation}
Of course, we will need an orientation on $M,G$ and $P$.    
%local product orientation on $P$ (see \cite[p.64]{bott_tu}).   

\begin{figure}[htb]

	\begin{minipage}[c]{0.38\textwidth}
        \caption{Horizontal subspaces defined by orthogonal complement}
        \label{fig:connection_from_metric}
	\end{minipage} 
\end{figure}
Denote by $\omega \in \Omega^1(P,\g)$ the connection on
$P$ induced by the metric on $P$ so that the horizontal and
vertical subspaces are orthogonal complements. Let $\eta_1,\ldots,\eta_d$ be an 
orthonormal basis for $\g$ consistent with the orientation on $G$.
We will show that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:principal_thom}
W := \int^B \exp(\omega) d\eta 
= \int^B \exp(\omega_a\eta_a) d\eta = \omega_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge\omega_d
\;\in \Omega^d(P)
\end{equation}
is the desired vertical volume form. Multiplication inside the Berezin
integral occurs in the graded tensor product $\Omega(P)\otimes \g$, 
so $\omega_a\eta_a$ all have degree two.

The integral along the $G$-orbit 
$\pi_*:\Omega^{*}(P\times V) \to \Omega^{*-d}(P\times_G V)$ is defined as in 
section \ref{section:fiber_integration}, where the integral defined by 
pulling back to a form on $G$ via a trivialisation
$\psi:G\xrightarrow{\simeq} \pi^{-1}(x)$.   

% construct left invariant metric on $G$ first
We will now turn $G$ into Riemannian manifold by 
extending a metric on $\g$ to $T_gG$ via left translations. That is, define
$\gen{u,v}_g = \gen[*]{DL_g^{-1}(u),DL_g^{-1}(v)}_e$ where $u,v\in T_gG,L_g(h) = gh$.
By construction, this is a left-invariant metric. In fact, because $G$ is
connected and compact we can turn it into a
bi-invariant metric by Haar integrating the metric: $\gen{u,v}:=\int_G
\gen{DR_gu,DR_g v}$.

\begin{prop}
	For all $p\in P$,  $L_p^* W \in \Omega^d(G)$ is equal to the unique
	Riemannian volume form induced by the bi-invariant metric on $G$. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\epsilon_1,\ldots,\epsilon_d\in T^*_eG$ be the orthonormal coframe dual
	to $\eta_1,\ldots,\eta_d$. At a point $g\in G$, the tangent vectors are
	transported to  $DL_g \eta_i$ while the coframe is transported to 
	$\epsilon_i\circ DL_{g}^{-1} \in T^*_gG$, where $L_g$ is left multiplication
	by  $g$. Then the unique Riemannian volume form is given by
	\[
	    \epsilon_1\circ DL_{g}^{-1} \wedge \cdots\wedge \epsilon_d\circ DL_{g}^{-1}
	\] 
	The covectors are orthonormal in the induced metric on $T^*G$ because the 
	metric is left invariant. For $X\in \g$, the pullback
	by $L_p : G \to P_{\pi(p)}$ of $\theta := \omega_a \in \Omega^1(P)$ is
	\begin{align*}
		(L_p^*\theta)_g(DL_g X) 
		&= \theta_{p\cdot g}(DL_p \circ DL_g(X)) \\
		&= \theta_{p\cdot g}(DL_{p\cdot g} (X)) \\
		&= \theta_{p\cdot g}\paren{\odv{}{t}_{t=0} (p\cdot g \exp(tX))} \\
		&= \epsilon_a(X)
		= (\epsilon_a DL_g^{-1})DL_g(X)
	\end{align*}
	where the second and third lines are applications of the chain rule, and the
	last line uses the property $\omega(\underline{X}) = X$ of a
	connection 1-form.
	This shows that $L_p^*\omega_a = \epsilon_a\circ DL_g^{-1}$, so 
	\[
	L_p^* (\omega_1\wedge \cdots\omega_d)
	= \epsilon_1\circ DL_{g}^{-1} \wedge \cdots\wedge \epsilon_d\circ DL_{g}^{-1}
	\] 
	as required.
\end{proof}
Assume that the metric on $G$ is normalised so that the volume of $G$ is 1.
In turn, we can show that the integral along the $G$-orbit $\pi_*W = 1$. 
\begin{cor}
	The integral along the fiber of $W$ is  $\pi_*W = 1 \in \Omega^0(G)$
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
	For $b\in M$, by definition we have $\pi_*W = \int_{\pi^{-1}(b)} W$ which is
	is computed by pulling back $W$ by a 
	local trivialisation $\psi : G \to \pi^{-1}(b)$. 
	Let $p=\psi(e)$, then $\psi(g) = \psi(e)\cdot g = p\cdot g = L_p(g)$ because
	$\psi$ is a  $G$ equivariant map. Then by the previous proposition, the
	pullback form $L_p^*W$ equals same volume form on $G$ at every point in the 
	fiber. Therefore, $\pi_*W = 1$ is the constant function on  $G$.
\end{proof}

The next proposition explains why $W$ is also called the projection form in
\cite{cordes95}.
\begin{prop} \label{prop:integral_horizontal_proj}
	Suppose $\eta \in \Omega^k(P)$ is an invariant differential form, then
	 $\pi_*(\eta \wedge W) \in \Omega^k(M)$ is the horizontal projection of 
	 $\eta$ onto $M$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Let $b\in M, p\in \pi^{-1}(b)$. 
	We know  $W$ is a top form on the vertical tangent space, 
	since  $\omega_a$ are all linearly independent in $V_p^*P$. Let
	$dx_1,\ldots,dx_n \in H_p^*P$ be an orthonormal basis for the horizontal
	cotangent space. 

	We may assume $\eta$ is a product of 1-forms. If $\eta$ contains any factor of
	$\omega_a$, then its evaluation on all horizontal vectors will be zero, which
	agrees with $\pi_*(\eta\wedge W) = 0$. Now suppose $\eta = dx_I$, for 
	an ordered multi-index $I\subset\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
	By definition of the fiber integral, for $v_1,\ldots,v_k \in T_bM$
	\begin{align*}
		\pi_*(\eta\wedge W)_b(v_1,\ldots,v_k) 
		= \int_{\pi^{-1}(b)} (\eta\wedge W)(\widetilde{v}_1,\ldots,\widetilde{v}_k,-)
	\end{align*}
	where $\widetilde{v}_i \in TP$ is any lift of $v_i$. In particular, at a
	point $p\in \pi^{-1}(b)$, we can choose them to be horizontal lifts, then
	extend to the whole fiber by right translation $R_g$. Note that if  $v\in H_pP$, is
	horizontal, then  $DR_g(v) \in H_{p\cdot g}P$ is still horizontal because 
	the connection form $\omega$ satisfies  $\Ad_g R_g^* \omega = \omega$. 
	\begin{align*}
		\pi_*(\eta\wedge W)_b(v_1,\ldots,v_k) 
		&= \int_{\pi^{-1}(b)} \eta(\widetilde{v}_1,\ldots,\widetilde{v}_k)\wedge W \\
		&= \eta_p(\widetilde{v}_1,\ldots,\widetilde{v}_k)\int_{\pi^{-1}(b)} W \\
		&= \eta_p(\widetilde{v}_1,\ldots,\widetilde{v}_k) 
	\end{align*}
	the second line follows from $\eta$ being an invariant form: 
	$R_g^*\eta = \eta$ and that is how we've chosen the lifted horizontal
	vectors. 
\end{proof}

\section{Atiyah-Jeffrey formula}
This section is a much more thorough explanation of section 2 of the paper by
\citet{atiyahlagrangians}, where a formula for the Euler number is obtained
starting from the Mathai-Quillen Thom form. 
The purpose is to formally apply it to the Donaldson-Witten context in the next
section. We consider the following setup: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $G$ is a compact connected Lie group of dimension $d$
	\item $P\to M$ is a principal $G$-bundle  of dimension  $2m+d$.
	\item Choose an $\Ad$-invariant metric on $\g$ using Theorem 
		\ref{thm:lie_inner_product}
	\item Similarly, construct a metric on $P$ which is invariant under the 
		action of  $G$, by averaging any Riemannian metric on $P$ with respect 
		to a Haar measure  
	\item At each point $p\in P$, this Riemannian metric defines an orthogonal
complement to the vertical tangent space. Since these subspaces are invariant
under the action of $G$, this determines a connection  $\omega$ on  $P$.
Moving forward, we will solely use this connection.
	\item $V$ is a real vector space, with $\dim V = 2m$ and a
rep $\rho : G \to \SO(V)$
	\item $E:= P\times_G V$ is the associated vector bundle.
\end{itemize}

% AJ p124, Naber p123
Our starting point is the universal Mathai-Quillen formula
(equation \ref{eq:universal_thom_form}), an element in the
Cartan model $S(\mathfrak{g}^*)\otimes \Omega(V)$, restated here
\begin{equation} \label{eq:universal_thom_form2}
	U = (2\pi)^{-m}e^{-\abs{x}^2 /2}\int^B
	\exp\paren{\frac{1}{2}\chi^{\intercal}\rho_*\chi - idx^\intercal \chi}
	\odif{\chi}
\end{equation}
where $\chi = (e_1,\ldots,e_{2m})$ is a basis for $V$.

\vspace{1ex}\noindent
\textbf{Manipulation 1: Replace $\Omega$ with  $d\omega$} \\
Recall that we can obtain a Thom form on $E$ via the Cartan map, which is given
by $\alpha\to \operatorname{Hor}(p_2^*\alpha(\Omega)) \in \Omega(P\times V)_{bas}$, 
where $p_2:P\times V\to V$ is the projection onto $V$, and $\Omega$ is the
curvature form associated to the connection $\omega$ induced by the
metric on $P\times V$.

The structural equation gives the relation
$\Omega = d\omega + \frac{1}{2}[\omega\wedge \omega]$, but $\omega=0$ on
horizontal vectors (by definition of horizontal subspace). Since the Cartan map
then only evaluates on the horizontal projection of tangent vectors, we can 
replace  $\Omega$ by  $d\omega$ in the Cartan map. 

\vspace{1ex}\noindent
\textbf{Manipulation 2: Replace $d\omega$ with  $R^{-1}dC^*$} \\
Recall that $C_p : \mathfrak{g} \to V_pP$ defined by  $C_p(X) = \odv{}{t}_{t=0}
(p\cdot \exp(tX))$ is the canonical identification of the Lie algebra with the
vectical tangent space at $p\in P$. Define $C_p^{-1} : T_pP \to \g$ on
$T_pP=H_pP\oplus V_pP$ by
defining the image of the horizontal subspace to be zero. 
Therefore if $\omega\in \Omega(P,\g)$ is 
the connection 1-form, then $\omega_p(X) = C_p^{-1}(X)$ since they agree on
all tangent vectors. 

Both $\g$ and  $T_P$ are inner product vector spaces,
so $C_p$ has an adjoint  $C_p^* : T_pP \to \g$. For $X,Y\in \g$, it
satisfies 
\[
	\gen{C_p(X), C_p(Y)} = \gen[*]{C_p^*C_p(X),Y}_{\g} = \gen{R_p X, Y}_{\g}
\] 
where $R_p := C_p^*\circ C_p : \g \to \g$. It is clear that $R_p$ is self-adjoint
and an isomorphism since $C_p$ is an isomorphism. 
Also note that $C_p^*$ vanishes on horizontal vectors, as 
$\gen[*]{X,C_p^*(v)} = \gen{C_p(X),v}$ vanishes on
all horizontal $v\in T_p$ due to $C_p(X)\in V_pP$. 

Hence, we have the
pointwise matrix equation $C^* = R\omega$, or $\omega = R^{-1}C^*$. From this,
we compute its differential to be
\[
d\omega = R^{-1} dC^* + dR^{-1} \wedge C^*
\] 
The last term vanishes on a pair of horizontal vectors, so again, we can replace
$d\omega$ with $R^{-1}dC^*$, since the Cartan map will only evaluate on the
horizontal vectors.


\vspace{1ex}\noindent
\textbf{Manipulation 3: Double Fourier transform to avoid inverting $R$} \\
The next objective is to remove the explicit inverse $R^{-1}$ by using the
Fourier inversion formula. Recall that the Fourier transform is an automorphism
of the Schwartz space on any vector space $W$. If  $dw\in\bigwedge^n W$ is a
volume element with corresponding dual volume element $dy\in \bigwedge^nW^*$,
then the Fourier inversion formula states that 
\[
	f(w) =
	(2\pi)^{-n}\int_{W^*}\int_{W}e^{i\gen{w,y}}e^{-i\gen{z,y}}f(z)\odif{z}\odif{y}
\] 
Note that for a real vector space the integral is the same if we multiply both
exponents by -1.
If we identify $W$ with  $W^*$ via some inner product, this becomes a double
integral over $W$. For a self-adjoint matrix $R$ with positive determinant, we
can compute  $f(R^{-1}w)$ by making the change of variables $w \to R^{-1}w$ and
$y\to Ry$, in which case $\gen{R^{-1}w,Ry}=\gen{w,y}$ and $d(Ry)=\det R dy$. 
The inversion formula becomes
\[
f(R^{-1}w) = (2\pi)^{-n}\iint_W e^{i\gen{w,y}}e^{-i\gen{z,Ry}}f(z)\det R\odif{z}\odif{y}
\] 
We now consider the universal Mathai-Quillen element as a $\Omega(V)$-valued 
function $U:\g \to \Omega(V)$ on the vector space $\g$, 
\[
U(\phi) = (2\pi)^{-m}e^{-\abs{x}^2}\int^B
	\exp\paren{\frac{1}{2}\chi^{\intercal}\rho_*(\phi)\chi - idx^\intercal \chi}
	\odif{\chi}
\] 
which we wish to
evaluate at $R^{-1}dC^* \in \Omega^2(P,\g)$. By the inversion formula above,
\begin{align} \label{eq:fourier_thom}
	U(R^{-1}dC^*) = (2\pi)^{-d-m}e^{-\abs{x}^2 /2}\iint_{\g}\int^B 
	&\exp\Big(\frac{1}{2}\chi^{\intercal}\rho_*(\phi)\chi - idx^\intercal \chi\\
	&+i\gen{dC^*,\lambda}-i\gen{\phi,R\lambda}\Big) \det R
	\odif{\chi} \odif{\phi}\odif{\lambda} \nonumber
\end{align}
where $\lambda, \phi \in \g$ are Lie algebra variables. 
\begin{remark} % naber p126
	Note that the original function $f(X)$ is a polynomial in $X\in\g$, and
	therefore not in the Schwartz space. This can be made more precise by
	inserting a rapidly decaying test function $e^{-\epsilon\gen{X,X}}$ and
	taking the limit as $\epsilon\to 0$.
\end{remark}

\vspace{1ex}\noindent
\textbf{Manipulation 4: Horizontal projection via integration along $G$-orbits} \\
% naber p127
The final step is to take the horizontal projection of the invariant element in
$\Omega^{2m}(P\times V)$ into $\Omega^{2m}(P\times_\rho V)$ using Proposition
\ref{prop:integral_horizontal_proj}. 
The intuition is that taking the wedge product with the invariant 
volume form $W\in\Omega^d(P\times V)$ introduced in the previous section 
kills all the vertical components. Hence we are only left with
terms which did not have a vertical part but now with a factor of 
$W$. After integrating out the vertical part of these terms,  
the result is the horizontal part of the original element in
$\Omega(P\times V)$.

In order to define $W\in \Omega^d(P\times V)$, we use the connection $\omega$ 
on $P\times V$, and assume $M$ is an oriented manifold. Also we
extend the metric on  $\g$ to a left-invariant Riemannian metric on $G$ as before.
Recall that the invariant volume form $W$ can be written as the Berezin integral
\[
W = \int^B \exp(\omega) \odif{\eta_1}\cdots \odif{\eta_d}
\] 
where $\eta_1,\ldots,\eta_d$ is an orthonormal basis for $\g$ consistent with
the orientation. We wish to rewrite $W$ using the relation $\omega = R^{-1}C^*$,
and we claim that this gives 
\[
W = (\det R)^{-1}\int^B \exp(C^*) \odif{\eta_1}\cdots \odif{\eta_d}
\] 
Let us write $C^* = a_i\eta_i$, where  $a_i \in \Omega^1(P\times V)$. 
If the top degree term of $\exp(C^*)$ is  $A \eta_1\wedge\cdots\eta_d$, then
the top degree term in $\exp(R^{-1}C^*)$ is 
\[
A (R^{-1}\eta_1)\wedge\cdots\wedge(R^{-1}\eta_d)
=(\det R^{-1}) A \eta_1\wedge\cdots\wedge\eta_d
\] 
which proves the claim, since $\det R^{-1} = (\det R)^{-1}$.
Taking the wedge product of the form 
$U(R^{-1}dC^*) \in \Omega^{2m}(P\times V)$ in equation 
(\ref{eq:fourier_thom}) with $W$,
\begin{align} \label{eq:AJ_formula_thom}
U(R^{-1}dC^*)\wedge W	
= (2\pi)^{-d-m}e^{-\abs{x}^2 /2}\iint_{\g}&\iint^B 
	\exp\Big(\frac{1}{2}\chi^{\intercal}\rho_*(\phi)\chi - idx^\intercal \chi\\
	&+i\gen{dC^*,\lambda}-i\gen{\phi,R\lambda} + C^*\Big)  \odif{\eta}
	\odif{\chi} \odif{\phi}\odif{\lambda}  \nonumber 
\end{align}
Note that $C^*$ should be interpreted as 1-form in the $\eta$ basis,
so we will write it as the sum $\gen{C^*,\eta}$ to avoid confusion.
In this step we have only taken the wedge product with $W$, so we would be left 
with a differential form on  $P\times V$, which we would need to integrate along 
the fibers to obtain the Thom form on $P\times_\rho V$. 

\vspace{1ex}\noindent
\textbf{Manipulation 5: Euler number of associated vector bundle} \\
% naber p131
Recall that the pullback by any section $\sigma:M\to P\times_\rho V$ will give a
representative of the Euler class. 
Then the integral over $M$ (assuming $M$ is compact) is the Euler number of the 
vector bundle, which is a topological invariant by the Chern-Weil homomorphism. 

Recall that as an application of the isomorphism $\Omega_\rho^k(P,V)\simeq
\Omega(M,P\times_\rho V)$, sections of the associated bundle are in bijection
with $\rho$-equivariant maps  $P\to V$. More concretely, a section $\sigma :
M\to P\times_\rho V$ is of the form $\sigma(x) = 
[s(x),S(s(x))]$ where $s\in\Gamma(M,P)$ and  $S:P \to V$ can be extended
to a $\rho$-equivariant map $S(p\cdot g)=\rho(g^{-1})S(p)$. The next result
shows that 
we can eliminate the fiber integral if we instead pull back the $V$ component
by $S$, and integrate over $P$. 

\begin{prop}
	For any invariant differential form $\eta \in \Omega^k(P\times V)$, and a
	section $\sigma = [s,S\circ s] : M \to P\times_\rho V$, 
	\[
	\int_M\sigma^*\pi_* (\eta\wedge W) = \int_P S^*(\eta\wedge W)
	\] 
	where $S^*$ only acts on the  $V$ component.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\omega \in \Omega^1(P,\g)$ be the connection on  $P$, and
	$\omega'=p_1^*\omega \in \Omega^1(P\times V,\g)$. We have 
	$W=\omega_1'\wedge\cdots\wedge\omega_d' \in \Omega^d(P\times V)$, 
	and $S^*W = \omega_1\wedge\cdots\wedge\omega_d\in\Omega^d(P)$ is
	the invariant volume form on  $P$, since each
	$\omega_i$ does not have any components in $V$. Furthermore, $S^*\eta$ is
	again invariant because $SR_g(v) = S(v\cdot g) =
	\rho(g^{-1}) S(v)$, so  
	$R_g^*S^*\eta_V = S^*(\rho(g)^{-1})^*\alpha =
	S^*\alpha$ where $\alpha$ is any form with only $V$ components.
	Taking the wedge product with $S^*W$ only leaves the horizontal terms in
	$S^*\eta$, so by equation
	(\ref{eq:principal_thom_local}), the right side of the equation is 
	\[
		\int_P S^*(\eta\wedge W)  
		= \int_P \operatorname{Hor}_{\omega}(S^*\eta)  \wedge S^*W
		= \int_M s^*\operatorname{Hor}_{\omega}(S^*\eta) 
	\] 
	where $\operatorname{Hor}_{\omega}(S^*\eta) \in \Omega(P)$ is the horizontal
	projection, so taking the pullback by any section of $P$ gives the
	corresponding form on $M$. 

	On the other hand, from Proposition \ref{prop:integral_horizontal_proj}, 
	$\pi_*(\eta\wedge W) = i^*\operatorname{Hor}_{\omega'}(\eta) \in
	\Omega^k(P\times_\rho V)$, where $i:P\times_\rho V \to P\times V$ is the
	section  $[p,v]\mapsto (s(x),S(s(x)))$ where $x=\pi(p)$. This section is
	chosen so that it has the property $i\circ \sigma(x) =
	(s(x),S(s(x)))$. 
	So the left side of the equation is  
	\[
	\int_M \sigma^*\pi_*(\eta\wedge W)
	=\int_M \sigma^*i^* \operatorname{Hor}_{\omega'}(\eta)
	\] 
It should be stressed that the choice of $i$ and  $s$ in the two equations above
are arbitrary, since the pullback of a basic form by any section gives the
corresponding differential form on the base space. Comparing the two equations,
we see that it suffices to prove the following diagram commutes

	If we include the pullbacks to the base spaces, we need to show
	$\sigma^*i^*\operatorname{Hor}_{\omega'}
	= s^*\operatorname{Hor}_{\omega}S^*$ on invariant elements 
	$\eta\in\Omega(P\times V)$. The terms in $\eta$ can be written locally in 
	the form $f(p,v)dx_I\wedge de_I$, where  $dx_I \in \Omega(P),de_I\in\Omega(V)$. 
	Since the vertical subspace is contained in the $P$ component,
	the horizontal terms in $S^*\eta$ come from horizontal terms in
	$\eta$. These are of the form $f(p,S(p))dx_I \wedge dS_I$, where $S_i =
	e_i\circ S$. Then pullback by $s$ gives $f(s(x),S(s(x))) d(x\circ s) \wedge
	d((S\circ s)_I)$. It is now apparent that this is exactly the same 
	as pulling back the horizontal terms by the section $x\mapsto(s(x),
	S(s(x)))$ as required.
	\begin{comment}
	Write $W = \omega_1\wedge \cdots\wedge \omega_d$ as before using the
	pullback to $P\times V$ of the connection on  $P$. 
	Assume $\eta$ is product of 1-forms since all the
	operators are linear. 

	If  $\eta$ contains any factor of  $\omega_a$,
	i.e. any vertical component in  $T^*(P\times V)$, then $\eta\wedge W = 0$
	and the statement holds trivially.

	The horizontal space at any point is  $H_pP\oplus V$.
	Now suppose $\eta$ is horizontal, i.e. $\eta = dx_I\wedge de_I$, where 
	$dx_i$ spans the horizontal
	space  $H_pP$ and  $dy_i$ spans the tangent space of  $V$. 
	Then from Prop \ref{prop:integral_horizontal_proj}, $\pi_*(\eta\wedge W) \in
	\Omega(P\times_\rho V)$ is the same form calculated by taking any horizontal
	lifts of tangent vectors. Then $\sigma^*\pi_*(\eta\wedge
	W)(v_1,\ldots,v_k)=\eta(w_1,\ldots,w_k)$, $w_i$
	is a horizontal lift of $D\sigma(v_1)$. 

	On the other hand, $S^*(\eta\wedge W) = dx_I\wedge d(e_I\circ S) \wedge W$.
	Then  $s^*S^*(\eta\wedge W) = $
	\end{comment}
\end{proof}


With $\eta=U(R^{-1}dC^*)$, we obtain the following element in $\Omega(P)$ whose
integral over $P$ is also the Euler number:
\begin{align} \label{eq:AJ_formula_euler}
S^*(U(R^{-1}dC^*)\wedge W)	
= &(2\pi)^{-d-m}\iint_{\g}\iint^B 
\exp\Big(\!\!-\frac{1}{2}\abs{S}^2+\frac{1}{2}\chi^{\intercal}\rho_*(\phi)\chi \\
	&- idS^\intercal \chi
	+i\gen{dC^*,\lambda}-i\gen{\phi,R\lambda} + \gen{C^*,\eta}\Big)  \odif{\eta}
	\odif{\chi} \odif{\phi}\odif{\lambda}  \nonumber 
\end{align}
This result is called the Atiyah-Jeffrey formula for the Euler number.

\textbf{Manipulation 6: Successive fermionic and bosonic integrals} \\
In order to integrate over $P$, there is a common notational tool in
supersymmetric physics where the integral of a differential form is written as a
Berezin (fermionic) integral followed by an ordinary (bosonic) integral. 
Suppose $\alpha \in \Omega^{2m+d}(P)$ is a top rank form, and $dV$ is a volume form
on $P$. Then we can write $\alpha = f(p) dV$. 
Let us denote the same form $d\psi = dV $ to indicate
Grassman variables for the purpose of the following Berezin integral:
\[
f(p) = \int^B \alpha(p,\psi) d\psi
\]
where the integral is defined locally by writing $\psi$ and $\alpha$ in terms of 
any basis $\{dx_i\}$. This naturally isolates $f(p)$, which can then be integrated
against the volume form:
 \[
\int_P \alpha = \int_P \int^B \alpha(p,\psi) d\psi dV_p
\] 
Therefore, the integral over $P$ of the element in $\Omega(P)$ in equation 
(\ref{eq:AJ_formula_euler}) can be written as 
\begin{align} 
&\int_M \chi(P\times_\rho V)\nonumber \\	
= &(2\pi)^{-d-m}\int_P\iint_{\g}\iiint^B 
\exp\Big(\!\!-\frac{1}{2}\abs{S(p)}^2+\frac{1}{2}\chi^{\intercal}\rho_*(\phi)\chi 
	\label{eq:AJ_formula_susy} \\
	&- idS_p^\intercal(\psi) \chi
	+i\gen[*]{dC^*_p(\psi),\lambda}-i\gen{\phi,R_p\lambda} 
	+ \gen[*]{C^*_p(\psi),\eta}\Big)  
	\odif{\psi}\odif{\eta} \odif{\chi} \odif{\phi}\odif{\lambda}\odif{V_p} \nonumber 
\end{align}
Note that terms like $C^*_p(\psi)$ merely indicates that we write the
covectors in $T^*_pP$ in terms of the variables $\psi$. 

\section{Application to Donaldson-Witten theory}
We can now apply the Atiyah-Jeffrey formula for the Euler number to the infinite 
dimensional setting of Donaldson-Witten theory. As eloquently put by \citet{naber},
the content of this section is not mathematics, and certainly not physics. The
objective is to find an analogue of the Euler number of the
infinite-dimensional vector bundle associated with the Donaldson invariant. In
the process, the well defined integrals transmute into Feynman integrals
over spaces of fields, with their accompanying mathematical difficulties.  
% some may argue that this is meaningless manipulation of symbols 
The objects we consider are 
\begin{itemize}
	\item principal bundle: $\mathcal{A}^* \to \mathcal{A}^* /\mathcal{G}$ where 
	$\mathcal{A}^* \subset \Omega^1(M,\ad P)$ is the
	space of irreducible connections   on a principal $\SU(2)$-bundle  $P\to M$
	over a compact oriented 4-manifold $M$, whose elements are called gauge
	fields.
	\item structure group: gauge group $\mathcal{G}\simeq \Omega^0(M,\Ad P)$
	\item vector space: self dual 2-forms $\Omega^{2,+}(M,\ad P)$ 
	\item associated vector bundle: $\mathcal{A}^* \times_\mathcal{G}
		\Omega^{2,+}(M,\ad P)  \to \mathcal{A}^* /\mathcal{G}$
	\item section: self-dual part of curvature 
		$\sigma : \mathcal{A}^* /\mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{A}^*\times_\mathcal{G}
\Omega^{2,+}(M,\ad P)$ defined by $[A]\mapsto [A,-F_A^+]$.
	\item equivariant section: self-dual part of curvature $S : \mathcal{A}^* \to
		\Omega^{2,+}(M,\ad P)$ defined by $S(A)=-F_A^+$
\end{itemize}
\begin{comment} % need su(n) or so(n) anyway
Donaldson only treats the case $G=\SU(2)$ due to technical reasons relating to 
singularities in the moduli space, however we do not worry about these details. 
Since our objective is to apply the Atiyah-Jeffrey
formula to the infinite dimensional vector space $\Omega^{2,+}(\ad P)$, complete
rigor is out of the question for this application anyway. 
\end{comment}
We are interested in the moduli space of ASD connections, which is why we
have defined the section of the associated vector bundle so that its zero set
is identified with $\mathcal{M}^*$. Note that the 
$\mathcal{G}$-equivariant map $S : \mathcal{A}^* \to
\Omega^{2,+}(M,\ad P)$ is the unique map associated to $\sigma$.

The main idea of Atiyah and Jeffrey is that we can 
obtain an interpretation of the Donaldson invariants as the
localisation of the integral of certain differential forms to $\sigma^{-1}(0)$.
 

% naber 133
We need a metric on the principal bundle $\mathcal{A}^*$ which is invariant 
under the isometries in $\mathcal{G}$. The natural $\Ad \SU(2)$-invariant metric 
on $\su(2)$ is $\gen{X,Y}=-\Tr(XY)$. There is also a natural $L^2$ inner product
on each of the vector spaces  $\Omega^k(M,\ad P)$, which  
can be written using equation (\ref{eq:trace_hodge}) as
\[
	\gen{\alpha,\beta} = \int_M \gen{\alpha,\beta}_{\ad P} dV_g = -\int_M
	\Tr(\alpha \wedge \star \beta)
\] 
for $\alpha,\beta\in \Omega^k(M,\ad P)$.
Since the metric on $\su(2)$ is  $\Ad \SU(2)$ invariant, the above metric is
$\Ad \mathcal{G}$ invariant. And since $\Omega^0(M,\Ad P)$ acts on curvature forms by
conjugation, $\mathcal{G}$ acts by isometries on the vector space $\Omega^2(M,\ad P)$.
As usual, this metric also defines a connection on $\mathcal{A}^*$ whose
horizontal spaces are orthogonal to the gauge orbits. 

Next, we need to work out the analogues of the maps $C,C^*$ and $R$. 
Recall that $\operatorname{Lie}(\mathcal{G}) \simeq
\Omega^0(M,\ad P)$ and $T_A \mathcal{A} \simeq \Omega^1(M,\ad P)$. 
By Proposition \ref{prop:gauge_derivative}, given $A \in \mathcal{A}$, the map 
$C_A : \operatorname{Lie}(\mathcal{G}) \to T_A \mathcal{A}$ is given by $d_A$.
Then relative to the inner products, the formal adjoint of this operator is 
$C_A^*=d_A^* : T_\mathcal{A} \to \operatorname{Lie}(\mathcal{G})$. 
Therefore the operator $R$ on $\Omega^0(M,\ad P)$ is the Laplacian
$\Delta_A=d^*_A d_A$. 

Finally, we need to interpret the Berezin and ordinary integrals. 
The Berezin integral on infinite dimensional vector spaces is well defined, 
but the issue is that our expression now has an infinite number of Berezin
integrals over the bases $\chi \in \Omega^{2,+}(M,\ad P)$ and 
$\eta\in\Omega^0(M, \ad P)$, and we no longer have a top
degree form $\chi_1\wedge\cdots\wedge\chi_n$ arising from the exponential. 
In quantum field theory, the infinite 
dimensional analogue is of this called the fermionic functional integral, where 
the integral is taken over the space of all fields/sections. 
Quantities like $\chi$ are regarded as a single element, while 
quantities like $\chi^\intercal dS$ are interpreted as an inner product $\gen{\chi,dS}$ 
with the element. The path integral of analytic functions of the fields is 
defined to be a formal limit of the finite dimensional case, e.g. a limit of the
identities in section \ref{section:berezin_identities}. For instance, the limit
of Lemma \ref{lem:berezin_det} becomes
\[
\int \exp(\overline{\eta}^\intercal K \eta) 
\odif{\overline{\eta}_i}\odif{\eta_i} = \det (K)
\to 
\int \exp(\gen[*]{\overline{\psi},K\psi}) \mathcal{D}\overline{\psi}
\mathcal{D}\psi = \det (K)
\] 
A similar interpretation holds for the ordinary integrals over $\phi,\lambda \in
\operatorname{Lie}(\mathcal{G})$. In fact, the formal limit of the ordinary
integral analogue of Prop \ref{prop:berezin_formula} is considered to be central
to quantum field theory (see Appendix A or Chapter I.2 in \cite{zee_qft}).



\begin{comment} % integral over $P$
In order to integrate over $P$, there is a common notational device in
supersymmetric physics where the integral of a top rank form is written as a
Berezin (fermionic) integral followed by a normal (bosonic) integral. 
If $\alpha \in \Omega^*(P)$ is a form written in terms of local coordinates  
\end{comment}



We can now interpret each term in equation (\ref{eq:AJ_formula_euler}).
We will evaluate the terms at the point $A\in \mathcal{A}^*$, corresponding to
$p\in P$ in the formula.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=\parindent]
	\setlength\itemsep{0.5ex}
    \item 
$-\frac{1}{2}\abs{S(p)}^2$ : 
The norm on the vector space $\Omega^{2,+}(M,\ad P)$ is the 
$L^2$ norm, so this term is 
\[
-\frac{1}{2}\int_M \abs[*]{F^+_A}^2 dV_g 
= -\frac{1}{4}\int_M \abs{F_A}^2 dV_g + 2\pi^2k
\] 
where we have used the property in equation $(\ref{eq:second_chern})$ for the 
second Chern number $k$ of the associated vector bundle.

	\item 
$-i\gen{\phi,R_p\lambda}$ : We know $\phi$ and  $\lambda$ are Lie algebra
variables in  $\Omega^0(M,\ad P)$. From above, we found that  $R$ is the
Laplacian $\Delta_A$. So we write this term as  
\[
-i\gen{\phi,\Delta_A\lambda} 
= i \int_M \Tr (\phi \wedge \star (\Delta_A\lambda))
= i \int_M \Tr (\star (\phi\,\Delta_A\lambda))
\] 

	\item 
$\gen[*]{C_p^*,\eta}$ : We have determined $C_A^*$ to be the formal adjoint $d_A^*$. 
This term is meant to be interpreted as a 1-form in
$\Omega^1(\mathcal{A},\operatorname{Lie}(\mathcal{G}))$, written as a sum over
the basis $\eta$ for $\operatorname{Lie}(\mathcal{G})$. By defintion of the
adjoint, we can also write this term as 
\[
\gen{d_A^*,\eta}=\gen{-,d_A\eta} = -\int_M \Tr(- \wedge \star d_A\eta)
\] 

	\item  
$i\gen[*]{dC^*_p,\lambda}$ : Recall that $dC^*$ is interpreted as a 2-form 
$\Omega^2(\mathcal{A},\operatorname{Lie}(\mathcal{G}))$. Our first goal is to
compute $dC^*$ at the point $A \in \mathcal{A}^*$. 
Fix $a_1,a_2\in T_A \mathcal{A}^* \subset \Omega^1(M, \ad P)$. 
Since $\mathcal{A}^*$ is contained in an affine space, 
$a_1$ and $a_2$ are associated to constant vector fields, i.e.
$a_i(A)=A+a_i$. Then 
\begin{align*}
	dC^*(a_1,a_2) 
	&= a_1(C^*a_2) - a_2(C^*a_1) - C^*([a_1,a_2]) \\
	&= a_1(C^*a_2) - a_2(C^*a_1) 
\end{align*}
since the Lie bracket of constant vector fields is zero. To evaluate these
terms, note that $C^*a_2$ is a map from points $A\in \mathcal{A}^*$ to 
$C^*_Aa_2 = d^*_Aa_2$. Hence,
\begin{align*}
	a_1(C^*a_2)_A 
	= \odv{}{t}_{t=0}(C^*_{A+ta_1}a_2) 
	= \odv{}{t}_{t=0}(d^*_{A+ta_1}a_2) 
\end{align*}
since $C_A^*$ acts as the codifferential on the affine space. 
We can compute $d^*_{A+ta_1}$ as follows. 
For any $\lambda \in \Omega^0(M,\ad P)$, from Corollary \ref{cor:adP_connection}
we have
\[
	d_{A+ta_1}(\lambda) = d_A\lambda + t[a_1,\lambda]
\] 
Recall that the formal adjoint is explicitly described by 
$d^*_{A+ta_1} = -\star d_{A+ta_1} \star$ for a four-manifold, so in this case,
\[
	d^*_{A+ta_1}(a_2) = d^*_A a_2 - t \star [a_1,\star a_2]
\] 
and computing the derivative at $t=0$ gives
$a_1(C^*a_2) = -\star [a_1, \star a_2]$. Similarly, 
$a_2(C^*a_1) = -\star [a_2, \star a_1] = \star [a_1, \star a_2]$, 
where the Lie bracket introduces a minus sign. 
Note that these are independent of $A$. 
Therefore, $dC^*(a_1,a_2) = -2 \star [a_1,\star a_2]$.
Finally, our interpretation of the term $i\gen{dC^*_A,\lambda}$ is 
\[
-2i \gen{\star[-,\star -], \lambda}
= 2i \int_M \Tr(\lambda \wedge \star^2[-,\star -] )
= -2i \int_M \Tr( [-,\star -]\lambda )
\] 

	\item 
$-idS^\intercal_p \chi$ : The remaining two terms come from the Berezin integral
in the Mathai-Quillen formula, involving the odd degree
variable $\chi$ which is a basis for the vector space $\Omega^{2,+}(M,\ad P)$.
So commuting the variables gives $i \chi^{\intercal} dS_p$.
Recall that we interpret the Berezin integral by treating $\chi$ as an element 
$\Omega^{2,+}(M,\ad P)$, and 
sum $\chi^\intercal dS$ as the inner product $\gen{\chi,dS}$.

From Proposition \ref{prop:curvature_derivative}, the
differential of the curvature operator $A \mapsto F_A$ is the covariant
derivative  $d_A$. Therefore, the differential of the section is $dS = -d_A^+$.
Since $\chi$ is self-dual, our interpretation of this term is 
\[
	i\gen[*]{\chi,d_A^+} =i\gen{\chi,d_A}
	= -i\int_M \Tr(d_A(-)\wedge \chi)
\] 

	\item 
$\frac{1}{2}\chi^\intercal \rho_*(\phi)\chi$ :
Here $\phi \in \operatorname{Lie}(\mathcal{G})$ is the other Lie algebra 
variable that we integrate over. The representation $\rho$ corresponds to the
invariant action of $\mathcal{G}$ on $\Omega^{2,+}(M,\ad P)$, given by pointwise
conjugation. Hence, the induced action on the Lie algebra acts on $\chi\in
\Omega^{2,+}(M,\ad P)$ pointwise by $\rho_*(\phi) \chi = [\chi,\phi]$. 
Then as before, the sum involving  $\chi^\intercal$ is interpreted as the inner
product on the vector space, and our result is  
\[
\frac{1}{2} \gen{\chi,[\chi,\phi]} 
= -\frac{1}{2} \int_M \Tr([\chi,\phi]\wedge \chi)
\] 
\end{itemize}

Not that all of the terms above are written in terms of the inner product on
$\Omega^k(M,\ad P)$, i.e. an integral over $M$ of the trace of a $\ad P$-valued
form. We can interpret the terms inside the trace integral as minus the terms 
in the Lagrangian
density. So putting together all of the terms above, we have the
Donaldson-Witten Lagrangian density
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}_{\text{DW}}
	= &-\frac{1}{4}F_A\wedge\star F_A - \frac{1}{4}F_A\wedge F_A
	+\frac{1}{2} [\chi,\phi]\wedge \chi + id_A\psi\wedge \chi \nonumber \\
	& +2i[\psi,\star\psi]\lambda - \star(i\phi \Delta_A\lambda) + 
	\psi\wedge \star d_A\eta \label{eq:dw_lagrangian}
\end{align}
where we have replaced the $(-)$ signs for the argument of differential forms on
the principal bundle with  $\psi$, since the Berezin integral over $\psi$ in 
equation (\ref{eq:AJ_formula_susy}) becomes a fermionic path integral, in the
same way as for the variables $\eta$ and $\chi$. 
Thus, our ``Euler number" for the vector bundle $\mathcal{A}^*
\times_\mathcal{G}\Omega^{2,+}(M,\ad P)$ is proportional to
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dw_euler_number}
	\int \exp \paren{-\int_M \Tr \mathcal{L}_{\text{DW}} }
	\odif{\psi}\odif{\eta} \odif{\chi} \odif{\phi}\odif{\lambda}\odif{V_A} 
\end{equation}
Note that we have omitted the $(2\pi)^{-d-m}$ factor because both $m$ and  $d$
would be infinite in this circumstance. 
\begin{comment}
Unlike the finite dimensional case, we do not expect	
the ``Euler number" $\chi_s(E) := \int_X e_{s,\Delta}(E)$ to be independent of 
$s$.  
\end{comment}


\section{Interpretation of Donaldson-Witten theory}
% AJ p129,130
% Naber p139
When the dimension of the zero set 
of the section $\sigma : \mathcal{A}^* \to \Omega^{2,+}(M,\ad P)$ (i.e.
the moduli space) $\dim \mathcal{M}^*$ is zero, the significance of the result 
is that after Wick rotation, our Lagrangian and 
Euler number are precisely Witten's Lagrangian and associated partition function
for his TQFT for Donaldson theory.\cite{wittenTQFT} 
In this case, Wick rotation is performed by replacing 
$\phi \in \operatorname{Lie}(\mathcal{G})$ with $i\phi$, corresponding
to analytic continuation. Witten showed that the partition function computes the
0-dimensional Donaldson invariant of a smooth 4-manifold, and hence we can
interpret this invariant as the intersection number of the section $\sigma$ 
and the zero section of the vector bundle, analogous to the Poincar\'e-Hopf theorem. 

In the more general case $\dim \mathcal{M}^* \neq 0$, we can take the analogy a 
step further, hoping for a representation of the
Donaldson invariants as the Euler class integrated against
other differential forms on $\mathcal{A}^*$, analogous to Corollary
\ref{cor:vb_localisation}. Note that $\mathcal{M}^*$ is the zero set of the
section $\sigma$, so we can say the ``codimension" of the Euler class
is $\dim \mathcal{M}^*$, as in the case of a transverse section of a finite
dimensional vector bundle. Let us briefly describe Witten's formulation of the
Donaldson invariants.

Let $\xi = \mathcal{A}^*\times_\mathcal{G} P \to \mathcal{B}^*\times M$ be the
principal $\SO(3)$-bundle introduced in chapter \ref{chapter_donaldson}. 
Recall that the map $\mu : H_2(M,\mathbb{Z}) \to H^2(\mathcal{M}^*,\mathbb{Z})$ 
is defined by the slant product $-\frac{1}{4}p_1(\xi) / \gamma$, which we can
denote as an integral over $\gamma$ for convenience.
There is a connection on this bundle induced by a metric on $\xi$, which comes
from the metric on $\mathcal{A}^*\times P$. 
The curvature of this connection 
$\mathcal{F}\in \Omega^{2}(\xi, \so(3))$ can be written in terms of the
components $(2,0)$,  $(1,1)$ and  $(0,2)$ in terms of the product
$\mathcal{A}^*\times_{\mathcal{G}} P$, describing
the multiplicity of cotangent vectors in the two components. 
Similarly, the Pontryagin class 
$\Tr(\mathcal{F}\wedge \mathcal{F}) \in \Omega^4(\xi)$ can be written
in terms of five components $(4,0),(3,1),(2,2),(1,3)$ and  $(0,4)$. 
The three components of $\mathcal{F}$ can be written in terms of the fields 
to obtain $\mathcal{F} = F_A + \psi + i\phi$, and thus Witten writes the five
components of $\Tr(\mathcal{F}\wedge \mathcal{F})$ as 
% Siye wu says this is Equivariant curvature in the Cartan model 
\begin{align*}
	W_0 &= \frac{1}{2} \Tr \phi^2 && W_1 = \Tr(\phi \wedge \psi)  \\
	W_2 &= \Tr \paren{\frac{1}{2}\psi\wedge \psi + i\phi \wedge F_A} 
		&& W_3 = i\Tr(\psi \wedge F_A) 
		&& W_4 = -\frac{1}{2}\Tr(F_A\wedge F_A)
\end{align*}
See \cite{witten_operators} for details on how $\mathcal{F}$ can be written this 
way. Let us denote 
\[
W_{\gamma}(A,\psi,\phi) = \int_{\gamma} \Tr(\mathcal{F}\wedge \mathcal{F}) 
=\int_\gamma W_i
\] 
Given $\gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_d \in H^2(M,\mathbb{Z})$, where 
$d = \frac{1}{2}\dim \mathcal{M}^*$,
Witten formulates the associated Donaldson invariant as the expectation value of
the operator $W_{\gamma_1} \cdots W_{\gamma_d}$ in terms of the path
integral and action \cite[eq. 3.40]{wittenTQFT}:
% Siye wu eq 5.9, witten eq 3.40
\[
\gen{W_{\gamma_1}\cdots W_{\gamma_d}}
= \int W_{\gamma_1}\cdots W_{\gamma_d} 
\exp \paren{-\int_M \Tr \mathcal{L}_{\text{DW}} }
\odif{\psi}\odif{\eta} \odif{\chi} \odif{\phi}\odif{\lambda}\odif{V_A} 
\] 
up to some constant factor. 
This should be interpreted as the integral over $\mathcal{A}^*$ of the product
of the Euler class with classes $\mu(\gamma_i)$. Thus by Corollary 
\ref{cor:vb_localisation}, the integral localises to the moduli space, and this
provides another way to understand Witten's formulation of
Donaldson invariants in the framework of topological quantum field theory.
