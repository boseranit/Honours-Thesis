Graphs: 
principal bundle connection from metric: cordes p159
graph for localisation in poincare hopf theorem
graph for tubular neighbourhood
invariant and horizontal form 
fiber integral diagram

Bryan questions:
should I include a proof of nabla^2 = F
should I include a proof Thom isomorphism? only for compact case?
proof of equivariant de rham theorem 


To write:
if I have an orientation for M and G, then is there a product orientation for P -> M 
No (e.g. mobius bundle): so check statements for fiber integral and universal thom

pullback in cartan map works only because projection is G equivariant

how integration along the fiber maps into associated bundle via Weil homo
