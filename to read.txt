Graphs: 
graph for localisation in poincare hopf theorem
invariant and horizontal form 

Bryan questions:
should I include a proof of nabla^2 = F
should I include a proof Thom isomorphism for compact case? 
proof of equivariant de rham theorem 


if I have an orientation for M and G, then is there a product orientation for P -> M 
No (e.g. mobius bundle): so check statements for fiber integral and universal thom


To write:
Include introductions at the start of every section
zero dimensional donaldson invariant
write witten's localisation properly
The case of dim M neq 0, and witten's observables
intersection number proof
