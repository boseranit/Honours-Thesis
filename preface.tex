Weyl (1918) introduced the concepts of gauge transformation and gauge
invariance, while seeking to unify electromagnetism with general relativity. After the
development of quantum mechanics, an idea was to make the global phase symmetry
into a local gauge symmetry by replacing the momentum operator with a covariant 
derivative in the Schrodinger equation, given by 
$\widehat{p}=\frac{\hbar}{i}(\nabla+iA)$. The result of this $\U(1)$ gauge symmetry
turns out to be profound, since it introduces EM interactions with a charged
quantum mechanical particle. This was the first widely accepted gauge theory,
and popularised by Pauli (\citeyear{pauli_em}).\cite{pauli_em}
Gauge theory was mostly limited to EM and GR until the paper of Yang and Mills 
(1954). They introduced $\SU(2)$ gauge theories for
isotopic spin axes, to understand the strong interaction. This idea later found
application to the model of the electroweak interaction by Weinberg and Salam
(1967), and also the Higgs mechanism (1966) for spontaneous symmetry breaking
allowing gauge fields to acquire mass. 

This also motivated the search for a strong force gauge theory, which is now
known as quantum chromodynamics. The Standard Model unifies the description of
electromagnetism, weak interactions and strong interactions in the language of
quantized gauge theory. 

The origin of TQFT can be traced to the work of Schwarz and Witten.
Schwarz showed that the Ray-Singer torsion, a particular topological invarint,
could be represented as the partition function of a certian quantum field theory
(1978). Unrelated to this observation, Witten gave a framework for understanding
Morse theory in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (1982), which was 
generalised to an infinite dimensional version by Floer. 

In \citeyear{don83}, Donaldson built on his doctoral advisor Atiyah's work on 
Yang-Mills instantons to introduce his famous polynomial invariants, and prove 
Donaldson's theorem.\cite{don83}
Freedman used this work to exhibit existence of exotic differentiable
structures on $\mathbb{R}^{4}$. 
Witten (\citeyear{wittenTQFT}) provided a way
of obtaining the polynomials by formulating a supersymmetric TQFT, which became
known as Donaldson-Witten theory.\cite{wittenTQFT}
Another approach to obtain topological invariants, related to Donaldson's
construction, comes from Seiberg-Witten theory (1994). They formulated a set of
equations that contains the same information as the Yang-Mills equations but
are technically much easier to work with.
