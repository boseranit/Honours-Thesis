Donaldson-Witten theory is Witten's supersymmetric topological quantum field
theory that realises the Donaldson invariants of smooth 4-manifolds as
correlation functions of certain operators. This thesis culminates with a
detailed exposition of the differential geometric interpretation of this 
formulation by Atiyah and Jeffrey.
They show that the action of the theory can be understood as an
infinite dimensional analogue of the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet formula for the Euler
characteristic of a vector bundle. The bulk of this thesis introduces the background
necessary to understand this. The framework of equivariant cohomology is
used to construct the Mathai-Quillen representative of a universal 
Thom form. We then demonstrate its application to localisation
of integrals, starting with a proof of the Poincar\'e-Hopf theorem and
proceeding to arbitrary vector bundles. Finally, the construction of Donaldson 
invariants is sketched before expounding the Atiyah-Jeffrey interpretation.
