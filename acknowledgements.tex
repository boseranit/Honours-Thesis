\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

Firstly, I would like to acknowledge and thank my supervisor Bryan Wang, who was 
always understanding, willing to listen to any problems I was working on and helped me
stay on track throughout. I want to extend my thanks to my fellow
honours student Brad Wilson. You and Bryan contributed substantially to my 
understanding of gauge theory initially, and we have worked on many problems 
together. I am deeply grateful for the invaluable feedback you gave after
meticulously reading my thesis draft. I must also acknowledge Ben Andrews for his
detail oriented teaching style when running the differential geometry course, 
which can be viewed as the start of my journey into this topic. 

In addition, I have sincere appreciation for my 
parents' unwavering support throughout my Bachelor's 
degree. And finally, thanks to my friends for always being there for me and
keeping me grounded.
